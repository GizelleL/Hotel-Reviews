11/22/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great Hotel Experience,"My husband and I traveled to Old Montreal for a 4 day get-away. The hotel was beautiful. It is decorated in a trendy, urban chic décor. It is very clean, and the staff was polite and helpful. My husband and I are frequent travelers; we look to stay in the nicest hotels available. There is curbside valet parking for all guests; and concierge service around the clock. We received complimentary wine every night on the roof top lounge, and a free truly continental breakfast daily with wonderful croissants, rich coffee, and fruit and chocolate. Old Montreal is decidedly European with most staff speaking multiple languages including English, French and Spanish.The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal and walking is a must. This hotel is located a block from the Note Dame Basilica, The historic waterfront, museums, shopping and restaurants.My one suggestion is not to stay on the top floor, as the rooftop bar and restaurant are noisy well past midnight, and the staff is up there cleaning and moving chairs and tables very early!",
11/19/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Hotel Nelligan,"In recent visit to Montreal to attend the IDF congress at the Palais Congress, stayed at the Nelligan in Old Montreal. Really enjoyed this hotel. Firstly, it was a great location- within walking distance of the Palais Congress (where the metro station is located as well). Room was great- spacious, tastefully decorated. Staff very efficient and friendly. Plently of restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommended.",
11/4/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Charming and chic.,"Excellent location in Old Montreal. Staff was friendly and most helpful with any special request. The morning breakfast buffet is really nice and much more than a continental breakfast. Rooms are a bit dark but ultra modern and comfortable. Free WIFI is a plus, too. Hotel is also near several excellent french restaurants. The concierge helped us with reservations and the meals were wonderful. The hotel also caters to groups with meeting rooms and other functions so it's a bit busier than the traditional boutique hotels.",
11/1/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great location comfy room,"Loved Hotel Nelligan! Boutique hotel in a great location in Old Montreal. Bed was super comfy, nice amenities, although the bathroom lighting was a little dark. Wine happy hour each night was nice, and Jean the concierge rocked! She really hooked us up at some great restaurants -- Restaurant Toque!, the Globe (for people-watching). Some people say it is noisy - but I thought it was super quiet, no problem with noise. Would definitely go back.",
10/19/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Delightful stay in Vieux-Montreal,"We stayed at Hotel Nelligan for six nights during a vacation to Montreal. We chose a 'King Loft' room. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was huge and spotless. (In fact, my husband took notes on the shower design for our next household renovation!) The style of hotel itself is trendy without being pretentious. The staff was attentive, friendly, very helpful with directions, and restaurant recommendations. The location is central to the old scenic part of the city, but not right in the middle of the bustle of the main tourist drags. We were in easy walking distance of Notre Dame and many cafes and galleries. I would stay at the Nelligan again on any visit to Montreal.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Charming hotel that I would return to again and again.,"Hotel Nelligan is located in the Old City of Montreal. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were elegant, comfortable and clean. I had a small issue with the location of the TV compared to the bed but it could certainly be overlooked. Morning breakfast was delicious and complementary evening wine and cheese was a delight. Highly recommended for couples, business or leisure. Not handicapped accessible but neither was anything else on the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal.",
9/29/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Gorgeous hotel excellent location in the old town,"This hotel was lovely, really well put together. Downside was that the whirlpool bath didn't work and was't fixed while we were there despite highlighting it twice. We were offered a room change the second time, but it was our last night so we didn't bother. When we mentioned this at check out they offered to wave the phone charges on the room ($10) with abit more pushing they only charged us for a basic room which was fine, but should have been their first offer in my opinion. Other than that a lovely experience. The continental breakfast had everything you would expect and the bagels were particularly good. We ate at the restaurant and it was pretty nice, food and service wer excellent, we would go there again.",
9/23/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Totally satisfied!,I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Nelligan. It was more than I expected! Everyone was friendly &amp; more than helpful. It had a very warm ambiance &amp; I felt so comfortable.We had a double room &amp; it was very tastefully decorated. We were facing the street &amp; there was never a problem with noise. The bathroom was spacious &amp; the products were heavenly!I would not hesitate to stay here again!,
9/9/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,An enchanting time in Old Montreal at the Hotel Nelligan,"If you're looking for a romantic hotel in Old Montreal (the historic center of the city) with a bit of boutique hipness and Euro style to it, Hotel Nelligan is a great choice. There's a reason why Hotel Nelligan consistently scores the highest marks on Trip Advisor and gets rave reviews in travel magazines -- every aspect of our stay was fantastic, from the romantic rooms to the sky terrace to the service. Best of all, the hotel is located on a cobblestone, very European-feeling street, close by to some of the city's main tourist attractions. That being said, the hotel didn't feel &quot;touristy&quot; at all. The name of the hotel comes from Emile Nelligan, a famous Quebec poet, and there are constant reminders about Ms. Nelligan throughout the hotel. Three great restaurant locations are attached to the hotel as well - Verses, Sky Terrace and Mechant Boeuf Brasserie (order the poutine!).",
9/6/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great stay despite some service issues,"Reviews here and on other sites accurately reflected our experience at the Nelligan. For a boutique hotel in a historic district, the Nelligan was very comfortable, quiet, and had nice charm. Many personal touches make this property seem like a great value in retrospect -- nightly wine and cheese hour, daily cont. breakfast, great bath amenities, fabulous bedding, etc. The downsides here were service-oriented and the issues we experienced seemed consistent with those expressed by other reviewers here. It was disappointing given we enjoyed the hotel so much but had to be patient with some issues that other hotels nail as a given at this price level. The few, basic inquiries we made of the staff were hit or miss on execution. Here are some examples: - We called down for ice on three occassions and it never showed up, so we just stopped calling....yet, other requests like wake-up calls were fine.- Upon our arrival with baggage, the bell staff (several of them) just stood around talking to each other and other guests, and ignored us as we struggled with getting in the front doors.....yet, at other times, bell staff went beyond the call to locate taxis for us down the street.- The rooftop terrace was a fantastic way to spend a sunset, which we did on each night, and loved it, but the service was horrendous to the point it became a comedy. They knew how to make only the drinks on the menu, and any request beyond that was literally discouraged by the waitresses (&quot;oh, the bartenders probably don't even know what that is, can you just choose something off the menu&quot;). While the wine list offered some nice glasses of wine at $10 to $20 a glass, one of the many glasses we ordered came corked and rancid smelling. We politely asked for a replacement glass, and the waitress wanted to have a long debate with us on the matter and try and convince us it was fine.- there appeared to be no service elevator at the hotel because day and night, the staff was shuttling push carts of food and housekeeping in and out of the elevators, cramming in with unsuspecting hotel guests. It made waits for the elevators noticibly long and frequently cramped; by day two we just started taking the stairs to avoid the hassle.- housekeeping in general in our room was very basic and inconsistent; only once did they actually seem to clean the room with cleaning products; most days, they simply made the bed and replaced towels, leaving dirty drinking glasses as they were, and surfaces hadn't been wiped down. All this said, for the few but memorable downsides, the place was really comfortable, well appointed, a solid value, and charming. We'd stay here again and recommend it to our friends without hesitation. Just be prepared for a little hit or miss service. I really hope the management will make some improvements.",
9/5/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Love this hotel,"Beautiful rooms, extremely friendly and helpful staff. Great location and atmosphere. Old Montreal is fabulous. I plan to come back with my husband for a romantic getaway!",
8/31/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Cozy relaxing and perfect location!,"My wife wanted a unique hotel with loads of character to spend our honemoon. Old Monteral was our destination and after some exhaustive research online she found Hotel Nelligan. We went in with very high exopectations based on reviews both here and in Fodor's. We were not dissappointed!The room was spotless, bed was very comfortable, the electric fireplace was nice touch (although slightly tacky in a Wal-Mart kind of way) and the staff was perfect. The brick walls were amazing and mostly soundproof. Our room was looking out onto the alley and wasn't that bad. I mean really, front, back atruim or alley, all windows in Old Montreal look right at the next building anyway.The location was a 5 minute walk to the Metro and there must be 30 restaurants/coffee shops/cafes or more within that radius. We went to 4 of each during our stay and review them elsewhere. We didn't take our car out of the Valet parking for all 4 days,Nelligan is afilliated with Rainspa in Place D'Armes Hotel and they arranged for 2 spa treament there for us which were very nice. We will definitely return to Hotel Nelligan in the Ffuture and will recommend it highly to any one who asks.",
8/29/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Excellent spacious room- go to Place d'Armes for the wine and cheese,"We stayed in Rm. 303 for two nights. The room was spacious and quiet though facing the street, had a king bed, luxurious bathrobes, a fireplace you can turn on even in the summer as it throws off no heat., and jacuzzi- I gasped when my husband showed me the bathroom. It was a very comfortable room seeing as it was so muggy outside. it doesn't cost much more than an average hotel for all this elegance.You can go to the Place D'Armes, their sister hotel, for the wine and cheese reception each night- the wine is better and the presentation of the cheese, fruit and bread is much nicer; you just show your ticket.I think this would be a very nice romantic hotel for a honeymoon!",
8/26/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,WONDERFUL,"Where do I begin from the momentwe arrived it was all about the service. Attentive,warm and friendly. The room was spacious and well appointed. Clean more then comfortable. The continental breakfast was well done and plentiful. I would definitely stay here again and again 5 thumbs up",
8/23/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great Hotel in Old Montreal,"I just returned from a one night stay at the Hotel Nelligan.It is well located in the heart of Old Montreal. It is very close to great restaurants and art galleries.My room was very quiet, and the bed comfy. The hotel is very clean, although the carpets on the guest floors are slighly worn. The gym, although small has a nice selection of weights and cardio. My room was large, with a nice shower and jacuzzi. My room was very quiet. The hotel price is very competitive to other hotels in Montreal that I have stayed in, although the Hotel Nelligan has far more atmosphere and charm than the average downtown high rise hotel. The complimentary wine and cheese was excellent, with the staff and other guests very friendly. The breakfast in the morning was okay, although nothing special, as it had the usual selection of bread and cereal, and the coffee was slightly cold. Hotel staff was efficient, and as a repeat customer I recieved a nice note and three tasty cookies. In all, a great and relaxing night in Old Montreal.",
8/18/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Perfect,"Beautiful rooms, wonderful service, perfect location",
8/13/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Shame about the service,"What a great hotel. Brilliant location near the old town centre. However we were very disappointed with the service. The maid service was slow. One day we had left the room very early and stayed out for more than 5 hours. when we returned, to get out of the blazing sun and have a rest our room had not bee made up. We asked if it could be made up and were told this would happen immediately. We waited in the bar for 30 mins and when my husband went to check if it had been done, they had not even started it. Another one hour later we were still sitting there, buying drinks from their bar ofcourse.We were just so disappointed as this was meant to be out finest hotel on our long trip. They didn't even apologize afetr the event. After checking out they didn't even ask if we had enjoyed our stay. The front of house staff were a bit rude. What a shame!!",
8/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,C'est Magique!,A group of 6 girls stayed at this beautiful hotel in Old Montreal. The staff was wonderful. The complimentary wine and cheese and breakfast were a lovely touch. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. The rooftop restaurant was fabulous as was our waiter Joe and bartender Jimmy! What a view and an outstanding burger!Thanks for a great stay!,
8/5/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,A well orchestrated tourist trap...American Travellors Beware!!!!,We stayed at the Nelligan in Montreal on your recommendation. The first night there after a day of travel the hot tub kept going on and off all night. Sleep was impossible. There were no towels. Lights were burned out in the room and no one would fix them...The room could not be properly cooled. There was no manager at night and the 2 young guys who were there at just started at the place. All they could do was shrug their shoulders. The wireless internet did not work but eventually I could hook up with ethernet. The manager (Kevin) the next day got the tub fixed but not after much coaxing and that is all that was done. By the last day we got some lights fixed. The front desk girls were rude and disconnected. The adjustment on the bill was $50.00. If this is a luxury 5 star hotel you have reset the bar just above the ground. It is a tourist trap. Warn your consumers or get yourselves off the market as a service to others that will get trapped like us.,
8/1/2009,can_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Could not find fault with this establishment,"This was simply a very good experience all round.Hotel comfortable, staff efficient and friendly and definitely not in your face.Definitely worth a visit.",
11/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location View Service,"The hotel itself is elegant. First class lobby that looked really nice. The bar was not quite right (bad drinks, service, nobody there). The indoor / outdoor pool they have is great for lounging. The rooms were very spacious. Lots of room to spread out. The beds were only OK for a room this big and nice. The views of the city and surrounding area were just awesome. The service was great, we ordered room service twice and it was fast and good both times.",
11/4/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location!,"This hotel was located in the heart of downtown Montreal only a few blocks from Eaton Centre and Crescent Street. Close to everything, including the metro. Hotel staff is great. Ramzi Ben Mansour, head of the loyalty program, does an excellent job accommodating guests. The concierge had several maps of downtown Montreal along with menus of the restaurants in the area. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at the Omni, and I would definitely stay here when in Montreal again.Traveler's tip on getting the most out of your stay: Make sure you sign up for the Omni Select-Guest loyalty program at the Omni website prior to checking in. You’ll get free wireless internet access and complimentary drinks for breakfast delivered every morning to your room.",
11/4/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Location Location Location. Omni standards do not go past the lobby.,"The location was convenient to shooping, restaurants and a short climb to Mont Royal's summit (a must see). Staff at Omni Mont Royal were gracious and helpful. Valet parking was reasonable and convenient. The currency exchange was pricey--better off going to a bank. Lobby and small bar/restaurant were attractive and well-maintained. But be prepared to pay more taxes than you thought possible on drinks at the bar--causing an $8 beer cost about $12. Website advertised two in-house restaurants--but we never found a second. This was a former Four Seasons Hotel, but you will be underwhelmed if you are expecting grandeur.Guestrooms were shabby and rather dusty for $160/night (which was the advertised rate) thankfully we didn't pay that much. Even the bathroom was dusty. Room was an average size. Carpet was old and buckling, making it a tripping hazard. No flat screen TV's here. Pillows were the best part of the room. Gym and pool area were dated but comfortable and adequate. No high tech equipment but you could get a full workout using free weights and Universal Machine. Treadmills were old but why use a treadmill when you can run on the mountain trails up the road?! Hotel has a small spa that we did not use. The hotel has a small boutique with great evening wear if you are shopping for an occassion--but there are hundreds of other stores in the neighborhood--street level and underground.",
11/3/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location - Needs a renovation,"I booked this on priceline. Was a little worried when I saw the photos. All in all not a bad hotel. Room was large though extremely dated ( Floral curatins, CRT TV , asbestos ceiling - all very 80s). I also experienced a lot of noise from the street. Location is unbeatable to main city centre and shops. For the price I paid it was OK - but I would not pay the direct online price. Solid 3.5 star for me.",
11/3/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,OMNI Mont-Royal - Amazing!,"Just returned from my business trip (with my wife also) and found the OMNI Mont-Royal to be an amazing hotel - We will be returning again and again. (check my other reviews I am not easy to impress) From the location, the Staff who greeted us, the Room and the Dinning everything was perfect! This is the level of perfection which all other hotels should attempt to reach. If you are going to Montreal you have to stay here!",
10/24/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Central bit dated but exceptionally clean,"We stayed here for three nights. The room was large and comfortable. The decor was dated -floral, swagged curtains and valances - but it looked literally brand new because it was so exceptionally clean and well cared for, as was the bathroom.The hotel is very central in Montreal. In one way for us this was a bad thing because it is a fair walk (but certainly walkable) to get to either the old town or the plateau, which were the places we liked the best. It is only a short taxi ride, though. Also, it is convenient for the shops, business district, and the park and university.The pool is outdoors and was well heated and usable in October. I think they may close it in winter so if you want to swim you should check.Overall we liked the hotel and would recommend it.",
10/15/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Well priced renovation will make it 5 stars,"The Omni Mont-Royal was a nice hotel priced properly in recognition for its need of an update to make it a real luxury hotel. As usual, this hotel had the extremely comfortable Omni bedding, and the room was a nice-large size. The furnishing, wallpaper, bathrooms, and general decor is dated, but according to management the hotel will be undergoing a renovation/update soon. After this occurs I have no doubt it will be a true luxury hotel, of course they'll be able to charge more as well.Check-in desk was very friendly upon arrival, but concierge service was lacking, to say the least. When we asked for recommendations of places to eat the concierge simply gave us a print out of restaurants in the area, that's all. I think that travelers expect, especially from a self-proclaimed luxury hotel, a little higher quality of service and help from the concierge when providing suggestions to out of town guest. Any person that can do a 15 sec. Internet search could have gotten that list. IMO it is the job of the concierge to give actual recommendations of places in the area that are good, not simply hand the guest a piece of paper w/ names. Having said all that, the concierge was the only blemish on an otherwise great stay at another nice Omni property that is only going to get better.The hotel is centrally located, near Mont-Royal, the museums, McGill university and a 5 min. walk to the old city/port area. Good location.",
10/14/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Spacious room and the perfect location,"Our room was a huge suite, more than we needed, but after reading some reviews about the suites being made over first, we decided to play it safe - with it being our 10th anniversary trip - and the cost uptick being reasonable. On the plus side: The location was stellar. We could walk to eat at many places easily, walk to the &quot;nightclub&quot; strip, but not hear it in our room. The shopping was right around the corner, and so was a hike up Mount Royal. The walk to Old Town is also very do-able. The room was nicely decorated, in a more traditional, older style. Not &quot;sexy,&quot; but nice. The beds and bed linens were wonderful and seemed new. Our double bathrooms were a nice surprise and quite large. A window that opened in the main room was nice. The closets were huge. Overall our stay was very comfortable and it is nice to know that we could go back to that room with another couple, or our children, and still have complete privacy and lots of space. On the negative: We were surprised not to find a fridge in the room, especially considering that it was a suite. We had Internet connectivity problems which created a lot of stress as we needed to tap into our email and mail our Cirque tix to the concierge to print. We were sent through a lot of loops to get help and the technology group we worked with couldn't see any problems with the signal. We wasted a couple hours with that. Then, the next morning, &quot;waa-laa: the signal was back and we got right online.&quot; It remained a mystery. Overall, a great place to stay.",
10/13/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,we were spoiled by Omni Hotel ,"My husband and I just returned from 12 days in Quebec area, and last 4 days in Montreal for a local wedding reception being held for us after our summer wedding in California. When we told the Omni we were attending our wedding reception, they registered us in their loyalty program, upgraded our room to a two room suite with a lovely view of the mountain and city!, and we felt pampered and spoiled the entire visit. Ramzi is their loyalty program director, and he was a prince. The night of our wedding reception my husband had tried to use the nearby parking lot and got lost coming back to the hotel to pick me up, and when Ramzi saw me waiting there, he refused to leave although he was already off duty, until my husband returned eventually and we were off to our reception. I also had medical items that needed refrigeration, and Ramzi got us a fridge for our suite, which helped me enormously. I have dietary needs and one day asked room service if they could toast my own wheat-free bread, which they did cheerfully and delivered to my room in a little basket. The service was perfect from everyone in the hotel, and we found ourselves online looking up where there were other Omni hotels in cities where we travel. I will be back in Montreal at least 2 or 3 times in the coming year, and hope to be able to stay at the Omni again. My only consideration is that we booked through a discount booking site online; I wish the Omni could match the discount booking sites so we could book directly with the hotel. We used hotwire which doesn't show the hotel name until after booking, but perhaps we'll try Priceline as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks Ramzi and Omni for a memorable extended honeymoon stay in Montreal.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,A solid performance from a good city hotel - raves for Omni loyalty program,"My impression of the hotel was driven by the amazing perks granted us by the Omni loyalty program. far from being frequent guests at this small chain, we signed up on line just days before our scheduled stay. The stay was for a friend's wedding and we were given a fair rate of about CAD159, I think. Check in was a breeze with no paperwork as we were &quot;preregistered&quot; as members of the program. Bell men and valet were friendly and efficient. The room was very spacious - I believe we had a King Dlx or something - on a high floor with views up to Mont Royale. There was a desk and table and sofa. Closet space was very good. Plenty of hangers. No mini bar - just a non-functioning refrigerator (used to be the minibar, I was told by the bellman). When informed I needed to keep some medications cold, he quickly ran for ice. It turned out that this was a big help as I would later find that the ice machines on my floor and the next THREE down were out of service. Bed is very comfortable with good sheets. The frequent guest perks continued with the daily pressing of one item of clothing (though there was an inroom iron, if needed). A complimentary bottle of Evian was also provided. And coupons for the delivery of free &quot;Morning beverages&quot; of choice and the offer of adding pastries/toast for a nominal charge. They brought a large pot of coffee and 2 large glasses of OJ and ice water each morning at exactly the time requested. membership also offered free WiFi in the room. The bathroom is fine - though a little dark and the ceiling is rather low, as I recall. I did my makeup in the bedroom area, as a result. The safe operates with a key rather than passcode, which is a little outdated, but fine). I think that a tighter security system would make me feel better about staying here alone in the future. Late one night a very shady character approached as we returned from a late dinner and then proceeded into the hotel, ahead of us, and wandered around the lobby before he spied the elevators and decided to go up. I am certain he was not a guest or even a guest of a guest- but there was no one in the valet area or front desk to report him to or to question him. A bit disconcerting. We had a drink in the bar on our way out on Friday night. I didn't think that the barstaff had the usual sense of spirit one might expect at a big city hotel watering hole. They were a little slow and disinterested. Overall, however, staff was uniformly courteous and housekeepers were friendly and cautious (no propped open doors, etc.). The pool area is quite nice and well protected from the breeze and the indoor/outdoor hot tub area was amusing. Amerispa (separate management) is the spa located in the lower level of the hotel. I had 3 different treatments here and all were good - though at the end of my facial, she tried to sell me more than $600 worth of creams with dire admonitions about the aging process - never a nice way to end a relaxing 3-hours. And that's all. Check out was easy. The location is fantastic - and there is an entrance to the underground city from directly under the hotel - which would be great for a winter weather trip. We would definitely consider staying next time we are in town and preferred it to the Sheraton, where we stayed a few years ago.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great location large rooms could use a rejuvenation.,"We stayed at the Omni for 4 nights. This hotel's greatest quality is it's location- plenty of excellent restaurants, shopping, and museums within walking distance. Try Chandelier for pizza- gorgeous inside and 2 for 1 gourmet pizzas while we were there. We stopped by a couple times! Easy walk to St. Catherine shopping. The hotel itself is not necessarily of the quality we've come to expect from domestic Omnis. The lobby is small, although welcoming. The rooms show their age, but are larger than you would expect. With a little facelift, this could be a great hotel. The service we'd received at other Omni locations was also lacking here. Usually the staff is falling over each other to make every attempt to make your stay enjoyable, well above average. The service at Mt. Royal was average, typical hotel quality. As an example, as part of their loyalty program, we received coupons for free pressings, but their pressing machine was out of order all 4 days of our visit. No attempt was made to find us an alternative. Overall, the location was excellent for a pedestrian, and if I were planning the same trip, I'd probably go back.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Not a Five Star!,"I was very dissapointed with the Omni Mont Royal. I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway with a few of my friends (some of which stayed at other hotels nearly - which were cheaper and much more comfortable) and was very dissapointed when i got to the front counter and was advised we were given a room with 2 twin beds. I had booked 2 double beds (they said i had booked for 1 person only ) and was advised that due to many hotel guests changing their bookings last minute that all they had left were either 2 twin beds or 1 king bed. Even though we each got our own bed, i was definitely not impressed that a five star would even offer twin beds?! The comfort level of sleeping in a twin bed is nowhere near that of a double or even queen. I had read some of the reviews before i had gone and have to agree that the Omni needs a major facelift. The staff at the counter was very friendly as was the bellhop and valet. We had a great view of Montreal but that was about it. i would not recommend this hotel until they renovate it.",
9/19/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Good Value - well located,"We stayed here for 2 days. The young girl who checked us in was very pleasant - though we have to say other receptionists were quite dismissive when we asked for change.Girl on conciege desk was very helpful as was the young man - though others were not and allowed people to skip ahead of me in the queue. One of the bellhops was topnotch in giving advice and even came into the lobby to help.The room was on the 24th floor and had great views over the city, it was clean and pleasant - I was a bit worried about other reviews of shabby rooms - but ours was nice if a little outdated . Linen could do with replacing though. The staff forgot to replace feather pillowa, but this was done quite promptly.The car parking was not great, with queues waiting to drop off luggage, you can park your own car without having to pay valet costs. Though we felt that some of the valet staff were keen to fetch our car and not too happy when we declined.Overall I would recommend the Omni for location and general good standard.",
9/12/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Pleasant Hotel in a Great Location with some Minor Flaws,"I booked my ticket on Priceline for around $100/night which, for the location, is pretty good. The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous, though the entrance is a bit hectic and chaotic. There is a parking garage on the adjacent block which was a trick to find, but since Montreal has a good transit system we were able to leave the car there the entire weekend. The room was a bit aged but clean for the most part. It did smell a bit of smoke, so next time I will definitely ask for a non-smoking room. On the back of the bathroom door we found the previous guest's shorts and panties on the hook - apparently they had forgotten them and housekeeping missed them. The room and bathroom were clean though and that was the only flaw I could find. We were on the 29th floor and the view was wonderful. The bed was comfortable, the room decently sized, and the bathroom was quite nice overall. Plenty of hot water and water pressure. The location is only two blocks from the bustling St. Catherine Street.. and only one block from the nearest Metro station. It's also close to the Parc Mont Royal which offers spectacular views of Montreal and plenty of walking and hiking trails. It is also close to McGill University. For these reasons, I don't think you can get much better in terms of location. I did not try the restaurant or the bar in the hotel. I did use the gym, and it was actually quite large compared to other hotel gyms I've used. It had plenty of free weights, machines, and towels - I was very pleased. The pool was very nice and clean too, and neither were very busy when I used them. The gym was actually empty on one occasion.There was also free high-speed internet. Overall, I did enjoy my stay in the hotel. Despite some flaws, I would stay here again, as the price was reasonable and the service friendly. I would recommend this hotel to others, though I would definitely not pay more than what I paid for on Priceline.",
9/12/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,What a surprisingly delightful stay!,My wife and I just left the Omni Hotel in Montreal and were very sorry to have to leave. To say we were treated like we were family is an understatement. We were treated so well it was a shock! From the registration personal to the service employees we had a stellar experience. The staff knew the city well and gave us excellent advice both on directions to the sights and to incredible restaurants. The location of the hotel was central to all of the places we wanted to see and the metro was just a block away. We are travelers. We have been in many places all over the world. The Omni ranks at the top of our experiences. Thank you for such a pleasent time in your city!,
9/8/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Good hotel in downtown Montreal,"We stayed on the 4th floor adjacent the elevator, which proved quite noisy throughout the night as people returned to their rooms.The room was of a decent size with good wardrobe/storage space, although would benefit from &quot;refreshing the decor&quot;. The hotels public areas seemed quite small but the service of the staff was excellent.Free internet service was good but valet parking $26.95 +tax and in-room water at $7 +tax were expensive. The hotel had a reasonably equipped gym, a hot tub and outside pool with sun loungers.",
8/23/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Lovely time at the Omni,"This review is a from a trip to Montreal my husband and I took in 2006, when we lived in Toronto (we now live in Montreal).We had found a great deal for Montreal's Omni Hotel on Expedia - under 100$ - and one of my biggest concern was getting a run down room or lesser service because of it, as is sometimes the case when booking online with these types of web sites. Not at all! Upon our arrival the valet was courteous and friendly, immediately assisting us with our luggage, and waited for us as we checked-in. The young lady who checked us in was nothing more than gracious, and she even commented with a smile that we were appointed a beautiful room, with a great view of the city. She was right! The valet chatted us to our room, asking us where we were from, and being very generous by telling us to not hesitate to call him if we ever needed anything. He actually wrote down his name and his extension on a piece of paper! The room was just perfect and exactly what we needed.We stayed for two nights, room was perfectly cleaned on the 2nd day when we came back, and our check out went smoothly, although the staff was not as nice or friendly as the young lady who had welcomed us. In fact, I found the young man who checked us out to be rather cold (the type who machinely asks &quot;so how was your stay&quot; while looking at this screen and who doesn't really listen to your answer) but the rest of our stay was so wonderful that we didn't pay attention to this detail. Parking is very pricey, but that is to be expected, however I will add that the parking service was efficient and fast.We loved our stay and will most certainly try the Omni again, in Montreal or elsewhere.",
8/21/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Wonderful hotel and decent rooms,My wife and I booked this hotel through priceline and were extremely happy with the rate we received. We were prepared for sub-par service as priceline customers but were met with incredible service over the phone and at check-in. As per some of the other reviews the rooms can use some updating but were still large and sufficient. With regards to Wifi as long as you sign up ahead of time as a Select Guest Member (you will start at Silver level) you can use your select guest member number to get on to the free wifi regardless of floor you are on. We were not charged for using wifi at the end of our stay. Overall the hotel and staff were excellent and we will definitely be recommending this hotel to our friends!,
8/18/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Service will truly be 4 star once the rooms are updated,"My daughter and I stayed at this property for 5 days. We got an amazing rate for the stay. I read the reviews in advance and expected the need for updates in the rooms. The service was fantastic. From the moment we arrived we were well taken care of. Bernard at the valet is simply adorable. A great asset! Our bags were removed from the car without asking and they just appeared next to us upon check in. We used the concierge several times and each time they were helpful. The location is fantastic. If you are into fitness they have great facilities with plenty of equipment and you can walk up the hill to Mount Royal and get a great workout on the stairs there! There is plenty of shopping near by. The Art Museum is right down the road (and free!). Easy metro to Old Montreal where we spent a great deal of time. Yes the rooms need to be updated. But it was not gross in any way ( and I have standards). The lobby and common space was great. I don't know if it was just a slow period, but it was also very quiet. Which was fantastic! If you are a spa regular, I don't recommend the Amerispa. I was disappointed with their facilities and the girl who gave me my facial had obviously just eaten onions (eww) She also was the same person to do my pedicure. Not a good sign. She was adorable. But not good at her job.Stay here while you can. Once they renovate the prices will go back up to 4 star rates.",
8/17/2009,can_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Brilliant Stay,"Stayed here as part of my 23 day tour of New England and Canada. Everything about this hotel, apart from the cost of a bottle of water, was brilliant!Super staff, breakfast and location. This was my first stay in an Omni hotel and i will certainly be using other hotels in this group.",
11/25/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,unexpected detour,"We had an unexpected detour. Montreal was not in our plans but it happens. The staff at the desk was awusume. Especially one, Ginette, she did far more that what any one expected. The hotel is on the metro and could not be better located. Thank you Ginette.",
11/21/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Deceptive,The remote battery was dead there was not sufficient wash cloths the bed wa squeekyThe service at the desk was rude and snoby The wireless is for a fee A good point were the employees at the garage friendly and helpfulI will not go back again it was very desapointing,
11/11/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Conveniently located in the heart of Montreal and great service.,The Hyatt Regency Montreal is located right in the centre of the city of Montreal. It is well connected to St. Catherine Street which is the main shopping street in Montreal which further connects one to 33 sq. kms of shopping area!The service is great and the room are spacious and comfortable.I highly recommend it to anybody visiting Montreal on business or for pleasure.,
11/10/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,A NICE PLACE,"We arrived a couple of hours earlier than check in and were told that we could not check in till 3pm, which was check in time. This was an inconvenience as we had to travel the streets for 2 hours while all we wanted to do was lay down and sleep for a few hours.",
11/6/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great hotel right downtown!,"Very nice hotel. A little confusing to find the lobby if you park in the Complexe Desjardins... but overall very nice room, great price and awesome view of &quot;Place des Arts&quot;.",
11/4/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great Location--average hotel,"Stayed 3 nights at the Grand Regency at the end of Oct/beginning of Nov. I was there for a conference, and this was the conference hotel. The adjoining conference center is quite nice, and the hotel location is quite convenient to Old Montreal, a metro stop, etc.The hotel is a bit disappointing. My wife and I arrived the first night to discover that they didn't have a king-size bed for us after all (the reservation had guaranteed it). Instead, we were given a single double bed for the first night. After a question about this, they gave us a coupon for the breakfast buffet, but we would have rather had the promised room. Fortunately, they switched it the next day, but it took all day to do so, and they didn't move our baggage as they said they would.The breakfast and hotel bar seem outrageously priced for what you get. Both are OK in quality, but not great.Location/cleanliness: very good to excellent.I think you could find much better hotels for the price, especially if you aren't going there for a conference at that center.",
10/29/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Not one of the better Hyatts but nice enough,"Location wise, the Hyatt is front and center to Place des Arts, which is usually ground zero for the Jazz and Franco Folies festivals, which can be a good thing. Otherwise, it's location is just OK, but it is right on the Metro line. Both times I stayed there, I booked through third party booking sites. Perhaps accordingly, I had odd rooms. The shower head and tap were in a weird spot and there was no minibar, which is always annoying (I'd like to at least have the option of using it if I want to).",
10/27/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Perfect place in Montreal,Great location near Old Montreal and other popular areas like St. Catherine and St. Laurent Streets. Comfy and clean and often available on Priceline for a great price.,
10/15/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Perfect Fall Getaway,"I have been a patron of the city of Montreal for many years and have stayed in lots of hotels. However, I must tell you this hotel was fantastic in location, service and amenities! The rooms were clean and comfortable. The service at the front desk, bellman, valet, conceirge, etc. were superb. The pool area is excellent with beautiful sliding doors, giving access to a pavillion with street views. The only complaint which is really not a biggie was there was no bar service until 5:00pm?! Just wanted to have a couple cocktails but ended up headed out on St. Catherine Street and hangin in the outdoor cafes. I highly recommend this safe(parking underneath the hotel), friendly and chic hotel to anyone familiar or unfamiliar with Montreal. Please feel free to email me if you have any other questions. :)",
10/9/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Good location good front desk staff,"Stayed there by myself for a marathon and got the executive package, which allowed me access to the concierge suite with free apps and private concierge. The private concierge wasn't great, as he wasn't around untill 1pm, but the free appetizers was nice Good location and friendly frontdesk. no official concierge, so if you have to ask for reccommendation you have to wait in front desk line which could be annoying if they were busy. Very close to good shopping, perfect location.",
9/21/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Decent,"Upon arriving at the Hyatt Regency we were quite impressed with the beautiful foyer and elegant decore. We'd seen on the website that they offered a romance package and figuring we might as well make bussiness trip double as a romantic weekend away. When we inquired about the 'romance package&quot; there was no such thing to our dismay.After checking in we realised that a long wait at the elevators was due to only two out of the four elevators were functioning it took over twenty minutes to get past the major line up.When getting to our room it was simple, an obviously dated hotel that had been given a few modern touches. Nothing spectacular. Spacious bathroom with a narrow bathtub, no options to upgrade to a jacuzzi. the room was adequate with a 21 inch tv, and king size bed that was quite firm. The room was clean upon arrival, we sayed for three and out of three days our room was only cleaned once, cleaning which didn't inclde restocking our minibed or changing the towels, as they are only changed every three days to save on cost. When we callled down for clean glasses and fresh towels, we were put on hold for 10 minutes after which we waited another thirty minutes, after calling down for a third time we finally had enough and went down to get our own glasses.There state of the art gym was lacking in the weight area, but is good for cardio. The pool was beautiful and kept at an amazing warm temperature. the lounging area for the pool is beautiful with a terrific sunroom. Right in the downtown area there is tons of shopping options and cabbing is easily done, fabulous location.All in all we paid a 125$ for a night for three nights stay, fabulous location. the hotel is absolute basic, no luxuries. My girlfriend stayed one night at 198$, for the same type of room on the same floor and would not do it again.",
9/18/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Mixed Emotions...,"Although well situated in the city, this hotel is by no means perfect. If you get a good deal, though, go for it!Most noteworthy...SET UP - As you've probably read in other reviews, it's a bit of a pain in the neck to navigate this hotel, as you first have to take an elevator several floors to the lobby before then doing the same to get to your room. Unfortunately, the elevators are a bit schizophrenic. LOCATION - Right in the mix of things - a short walk here and a short walk there. Also situated above a mall (with a full grocery store!).FITNESS / RELAXATION - As part of an apparent renovation, they clearly paid attention to the addition of a decent workout room with ample equipment. Also, the pool and deck area were very enjoyable. Be sure to enjoy the sauna and steam area, too.ROOM - This is where things start to get a bit sad. Although recently renovated, it looked somewhat worked over - not bad by any means but certainly not what you might expect given a recent makeover.SERVICE - A spotty area as well. Check in was a bit of a mess with a line of people and a desk staff that seemed off their game - unable to deal well with the volume of people and a variety of issues. One evening, the hotel hosted a wedding reception with music that kept hotel guests awake until 2:00 AM. Staff/management was ill-equipped to deal with this sort of frustration from guests.",
9/2/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,it will do,"location: it's a pretty far walk from old montreal, but it's walkable. with some connecting stops on the subway you can get to old montreal from the hotel to the champs-de-mars stop. the hotel is located about 2 blocks away from what i'd consider to be montreal's &quot;red light district.&quot; it is located on st. catherine street and if you walk a couple of blocks (5-6) towards dairy queen you start to hit some decent shopping.Eating: The diner, Eggspectations, is right down stairs, they make reallly good french toast! and the hotel is located right above the Complex des jardin's food court. the hotel has a restaurant, aswell, but it was under renovations while i was there.hotel: small rooms, dimly lit, basic amenities, small bathroom, not impressed. wouldn't stay again.",
8/26/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great hotel!,"We stayed here 2 nights and it was a lovely hotel. We were asked if we'd like 2 double beds or a king bed, so we took the latter. The room was spacious and comfortable, though my partner had a stiff/sore neck from the pillows but I guess he could have brought his own. The staff are very helpful and will tell you where to go if you don't quite know, or how to get to where you do want to go (Maria was helpful and saved us a long walk because my partner was under the impression that it wasn't so far away but it was, and Olga recommended which streets to wander for some nice restaurants). The gentlemen at the parking are great too - very nice, courteous and willing to help out in any way that they can (regular parking is $19, but each time you take your car out you will have to pay again, so we went with valet parking, which is $26 a day).We were able to get internet, 2 hours for $5 (and there are various other options for other prices), but once we also took advantage of the Starbucks across the street, bought some coffees and used their wifi.Only complaint - the washroom. Very small but still, it was clean and everything (although not so much the tub) was quite nice.",
8/26/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great renovation of this nearly 35 year old hotel. . .,"This hotel started life as Le Meridien, and later had a Radisson flag on it, before the most recent renovation that sees the property managed by Hyatt. In the years since its opening just before the Olympics, its Complexe Desjardins location, across from Place des Arts, hasn't changed, but Montreal has gotten more interesting going eastward, so the hotel is more central than ever. . .Kudos to the owners and designers who carried out this renovation. Given the age of the hotel--a lot of Montreal was erected in the mid 60s to mid 70s, for the Expo 67 and 1976 Olympics, and not all has aged gracefully--the refurbishment was a near gut rehab. And a thorough one at that. . .new and fresh lobby, guest rooms, lounge areas, and fitness center.Rooms are not huge, but they are ample and airy. The original design of the building, sort of a checkerboard pattern, provides just half a window to the outside. Supposedly, the view I received, out over Place des Arts and a slice of Mount Royal, is a premium one with a surcharge--the front desk agent gave it to me as 1) I requested it, and 2) she was not sold out. Very nice of her, but the view would not be worth the $20 per night extra cost. Great Hyatt beds, in-room coffee, and brand new carpet are highlights. Odd that they did not install flat screen TVs given the newness of the reno effort. Bathrooms are well laidout, and more pleasant than their size would indicate. Great bumpy Portico soap and curved shower rods are nice touches, though the vanity has just one sink, and a small area at that.Interestingly, Priceline categorizes this hotel as a 3 1/2 star, while its freshness and amenities would be closer to 4 star in my book (especially given some of what Priceline does call 4 star). That rating accounts, in part, for the $63 US room rate bid that Priceline accepted--a steal for this hotel. It is to the hotel's credit that I was treated with VIP service, and upgraded even with this--some hotels treat you like the great unwashed if you are a Priceline purchaser.The hotel lobby is seven stories above the street, and the double elevator rides get a bit tedious--the trip to your room requires an elevator to the lobby, then a second set of elevators to get you through the guest room tower.The Complexe Desjardins/Place des Arts location puts guests within underground access to two Metro stations (with similar names, Place des Arts, and Place d'Armes), the Convention Center, and much of the rest of downtown Montreal's vast tunnel system. Complexe Desjardins, itself, is a large mall and office complex (the center court is one of the most voluminous retail spaces in the world. .) with a considerable food court at the lower level. Place des Arts, right across St. Catherine St. is Montreal's answer to Lincoln Center, with a number of performance spaces, and the hall for the Montreal Symphony. Chinatown is nearby, and the main downtown shopping stretch along St. Catherine is just a few blocks to the west of the hotel. St. Catherine going east, from about St. Urbain to St. Denis, is the closest thing downtown Montreal has to a red light district, and while it is not aggressively awful, it is not pretty, particularly at night. The gay Village starts just beyond St. Denis, about a 15 minute walk east. And north along St. Denis is the Quartier Latin, with countless cafes and restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk. Visitors who take the train into Central Station have about a six block walk.Overall the Hyatt can be a great choice, particularly when Priceline bids in the $60-70 range are accepted. Even at full price, the location and stylish renovation make this a strong hotel to consider for a Montreal visit.Good things:Complete renovation of a 34 year old hotel—stylish and comfortable update.Notably central location—within Complexe Desjardins for shopping and dining options, across from Place des Arts, and connected to underground city/convention center—covered access to two Metro stations.Brand new fitness facility and pool area, with sun deck, fitness center use freeGreat beds, new carpet, and numerous outlets—nice Portico bath products, and curved shower rods.Solid service—upgrade at front desk despite Priceline booking, waived two local calls’ charge, responsive housekeeping staff.Free in-cup coffee maker (though include paper cups—mugs only doesn’t cut it)Refrigerator, not mini bar, in room.Not good things:Not in the center of downtown—five blocks from core.Neighborhood just to east of the hotel along St. Laurent kind of sketchy.Double elevator—ground floor to lobby, then lobby to guest room tower—makes for longer time to room. As well, frequent elevator stops.Despite recent renovation, retained old style televisions.Charge for internet in rooms.",
8/18/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,WiFi not included,"I know its a minor thing, but the website suggested it was in the room. Like the towels and electricity we assumed it was included. It was not and forced us to use free services elsewhere. The TV was also an extra fee. The sink was plugged whenever we used it. And needless to say we spent as little time here as possible. Good points. The room was clean, the beds were made every morning and aside from listening to the FrancoFollies every night it was fairly peaceful on the 11th or so floor.",
8/18/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Clean comfortable good location... but not worth 4 stars,"I booked this hotel on Hotwire for about $96 USD/night. I wouldn't pay much more than that however.Good... clean, great downtown location, comfortable beds, friendly staff.Bad... it's not 4 star as advertised. 3.5 sure. The rooms and bathrooms need a little updating. Hotel movie had background &quot;static&quot;. Not great when you pay $12.99 for one.The real bad... the air conditioning. It was really warm in Montreal (above 30 degrees). The AC in the rooms couldn't keep up . While we had it on max, it was about 24 degrees in the room. They first came up... said it was broke... they'd send a repair person the next morning and if that didn't work, they'd change us to another two double room. And they sent a fan up. Next morning... nothing. We left for the day. Came back... called again... said they would call back in a few. No call. Third time he said he'd check into it. Nothing. Friendly but not very organized.Talking to other guests... we're thinking it wasn't broke and it just sucked to begin with.",
8/18/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Nice Stay Great Pool,"I stayed for 3 nights from August 8th to August 11th with my wife, 13 year old daughter and 8 year old daughter. The check-in was easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We found the Hyatt to be reasonably priced and and wonderfully situated. You can walk to all the downtown attractions and Old Montreal. The subway is directly under the hotel and can take you anywhere you want to go. There are many coffee shops with excellent muffins and pastries in the food court in the mall underneath the Hyatt which is only an elevator ride away and very convenient when you are traveling with children. The indoor pool was wonderful. When they opened all the glass doors around the pool we got a beautiful view of the city from the pool area. As one reviewer stated, there could have been more chairs around the pool but if that's going to ruin your vacation then stay home. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.",
8/15/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,definitly not a 4 star hotel,Not as good as the other Hyatts. Check in took forever. Valet parking was very slow. Rooms were clean but the bathroom had mold.,
8/15/2009,can_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Worth it on sale.... otherwise?,"This hotel does not meet the Hyatt standards. While the staff is nice, and the location is great, the hotel is run down. The common spaces and rooms are nicely furnished, but for a hotel that is supposed to be four star, it's not. Rooms need money spent to update them (i.e. flat screen t.v.s) It's difficult to get into the hotel (one elevator to the lobby, and then one to the rooms), but it's location makes it worth $100 a night, not much more. Having stayed at another Hyatt property this week, I was disappointed with this one.",
10/22/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,great location in addition to a charming little italian restaurant,"this really made our trip pleasurable and comfortable! the hotel's cleanliness and spacious rooms, in addition to the very professional staff, are only outshone by the good location in downtown Montreal as well as the lovely Italian restaurant where we took our lunch and cappucino. great value for money.",
10/20/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Best hotel of our entire trip,"We stayed in Montreal for 2 nights as part of a 5 week Canada and USA trip. This hotel was a highlight - well located within easy walking distance of the train station and the main shopping strip, yet in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. The room was huge, with a full kitchen/dishwasher and dining table, and the king sized bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel has a guest laundry and indoor pool on the top floor, and a no charge business centre for internet/computer access. Everything that a traveller needs. Reception staff were efficient and professional and there was no issue with us conversing in English. The only suggestion that I would make to the hotel is to improve the information contained within the guest services directory - there was no mention of the guest laundry, which we found quite by accident as we were exploring the pool area.",
10/9/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,We were very pleased!,"We spent 3 nights at Le Square Phillips and were very pleased with our choice. We booked a standard king suite through hotels.com for approximately $150/night. Given the location in a major metropolitan city, we felt we received an excellent value. As others have written, the rooms are huge. Spacious living area with very tall ceilings, a table with 4 chairs, a fully functional kitchen with full-size refrigerator and oven. The bathroom was adequate if on the older side. The bed was fine but firm, which we like but beware if firm mattresses don't agree with you. The bedding could have been of higher quality (you could nearly see through the sheets). Quiet stay and no issues with maid service.The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast which is on par with most complimentary hotel breakfasts. Plenty of cereal and pastry selections, fruit, yogurt, juice &amp; coffee.We loved the size of the room and the location in Montreal. We walked everywhere or took the Metro. Would definitely stay here again if we return.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Rare combo of chic and friendly,"We chose this hotel based on other tripadvisor reviews, and we're glad we did. It was a rare combo of chic and friendly. My husband and I loved the urban vibe, and the kids loved the room, the pool, and the breakfast. The hotel is well located, with friendly and helpful staff. A few caveats for families with young kids, though. The pool is 4m deep from end to end - too deep for kids to stand. Great looking flat screen tvs in rooms had limited kid-friendly channels, especially in English. Minor points, really, in an otherwise great stay.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Excellent Hotel!,"Le Square Phillips is an excellent hotel. The location is ideal; it is centrally located and near several Metro stops. Our room was great; the kitchen was well-equipped, the view was nice, and the unique architecture of building really stood out in the room design. I would recommend the hotel to families and couples alike. The free internet access on hotel computers and breakfast were added bonuses that a lot of up-scale hotels don't include in their offers.",
10/4/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great location,"Stayed for 5 nights in a double studio room. Hotel is just minutes from busy Rue Catherine but very quiet. Additionally, the hotel is also a short walk to Chinatown, Old Montreal and Metro lines. The room was just as the picture showed on their web page and had a spacious area where the dining table/kitchen was located. The bathroom was large and very clean.The continental breakfast options (included in the hotel rate) were okay but we chose to buy a selection of items at the markets (see my reviews of the Jean Talon and Atwater markets) on a couple of the days instead of the hotel provided breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.",
9/24/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Nice Hotel,"Located downtown, about a 20 minute walk to Old Town but close to many other attractions this is a smaller hotel with really big, comfortable rooms. Valet parking is $20 a day. Staff was cordial and helpful. Continental breakfast was included but that is my only minor complaint. Very basic, Motel 6-type spread.",
9/8/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,great deal on a conveniently located hotel friendly staff clean pack n play crib,"We stayed here on a 5-day vacation in August 2009. Had a nice problem-free stay in a large room (for no particular reason, we were upgraded to a larger suite than we booked). Fully equipped kitchen was nice- housekeeping did our dishes even though I think that was our responsibility. Room was nice and spacious but not fancy. Plenty of closet space. Clean Pack N Play crib was available for our one-year-old (although no one brought sheets). Hotel was quiet, staff were extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants, etc. Pizza place Il Focolaio a couple doors down was really good and had outdoor seating. French restaurant a block away Restaurant Julien was good but pricier. Rooftop pool and deck were small but nice to have. Valet parking was $20 per day. Free internet worked fine (have to ask for a password at the front desk). Free breakfast included the usual fare- sometimes we skipped it. Would stay here again.",
9/8/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Large and comfortable bed,"A great hotel: large and comfortable bed, large and quiet room, very convenient location.",
9/3/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,worst hotel experience in 10 years,"most overrated hotel. made a reservation based on trip advisor rating bnut TA way off on this one. arrogant check in staff, cold impersonal room, internet connection terrible, coffee and breakfast must be avoided. Room was large but so what. i had to empty the dishwasher when i checked in to get a cup for coffee. The gym is useless. Montreal is a great city. this hotel is like a plain vanilla hotel in any city. no feeling at all that one is in such a great city.I would never stay here again. do yourself a favor and find another hotel to stay in Montreal",
9/1/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Largest room ever,"Our Junior Suite 411 at the Square Phillips was the largest room I ever have experienced in my 25+ years of travelling around the globe. I took 19 large steps from the kitchen end to the window end and almost 6 steps the narrow side, This included bedroom, living room and kitchen. Partitions separated them somewhat. Additionally comes a long isle opening to a medium sized bathroom with missing decor and a walk in closet. Overall easily more than 100 square meters. Amazing! Obviously they had some space left when transforming the office building into a hotel. Location was good, though you needed ground transportation to go to the trendy latin quarter. Staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel was quiet though we had some loud neighbors baging doors Sunday early morning.Just one question: Who needs 2 oversized flat screen TVs in listening distance? WiFi worked fine.",
8/28/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Good Value,"Stayed here for two nights on a Friday and Saturday in late August as part of a trip to Montreal &amp; Quebec City. Great Value. Good location, easy-in easy out with Valet Parking. Its within walking distance of shopping old Montreal &amp; Chinatown (although a bit far for the later two).We had a large roon with a full kitchen complete with refrigerator, microwave, table plates and utensils. Breakfast was included but is limited but adequate(cereal, bagels, peanut butter, bread, muffins and fruit).Would certainly recommned for families and for longer satys.",
8/27/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Ideal location but not perfect,"The location in downtown Montreal cannot be beaten - ideal for shopping, cultural activities, visits to museums and old Montreal. The rooms are certainly large with confortable beds, although the decor and bathrooms appear somewhat dated. Free internet access if provided to those with their own computer - otherwise at the business centre on the first floor. Breakfast is served until 0930 and the breakfast room gets overcrowded with families vying for tables and squeezing past each other to get to the food - which is basic fare. Check in staff were OK but did not bother to explain the hotel's facilities. The biggest pain was the housekeeping staff - they will even enter the room while you are at breakfast and before you are even ready for the day ahead, or they will call you on the phone to ask when you are leaving. However, their activities did not seem to stretch to changing the bed linen - during a week long stay, this did not happen once.",
8/26/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Wonderful location and lots nearby,"I stayed for three nights and it was wonderful! Check in was quick and the staff friendly. Concierge answered my questions and mapped out where/how to get to places. Valet parking was easy. Location is great. You are 1 1/2 blocks from Ste Catherine's Street which is very active with lots of restaurants, shops, and people. I felt fine to walk around alone. You are also within blocks of many churches and museums. Leave your car with the valet and use subway and buses. The system was easy to get around. Breakfast at the hotel was fine...mostly breads, fruit, cereal and juice...enough for me. My room was quite large and when I asked apparently I had a smaller room. It had 2 beds, a full kitchen and a large bathroom. Very clean. I would definitely plan to stay there again.",
8/24/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great for teens,Great location. Big rooms which our two teenagers liked. Excellent service and very secure. Two Internet terminals in business centre at lobby level. Breakfast could be better if there were more choices. Small gym and beautiful swimming pool on top level. Also a nice deck on roof. Central to downtown Montreal. Beds are very firm but we were ok with them. Would definitely go back.,
8/24/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great set up all-around,We spent four nights in a two bedroom suite - incredibly spacious. The hotel is very centrally located so you can walk in many different directions. The included breakfast is very simple but it is quick and easy and filling. It is very nice not to have to look for another restaurant for a meal.The pool is small but very nice with a nice roof-top deck.The hotel is very quiet. I was always surprised at how many people were in the breakfast room given that we didn't hear or see them at any other time of day.We will definitely go back to this hotel,
8/23/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Lovely---Perfect for our little family.,"Most have already covered what we would say. It would be nice to see a bit more variety in the breakfast, but that is our only small quibble. It is so comfortable, and the service was fabulous--they were lovely and classy, and not at all pretentious. The pizza place a few doors down had good thin-crust pizza--you can take it back to your room or eat on the patio area there, so it's really convenient. The hotel downstairs was nice, but a bit pricier/nicer than necessary for a family with an impatient small child. They were very accommodating, but it was kinda wasted on her 4-year-old sensibilities.",
8/22/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Best hotel on the planet,"HUGE, HUGE room with FULL FRIDGE, MicroWave, 4-burner stove and *EVERYTHING*, very reasonable prices (for Montreal), totally awesome staff!They are large enuf to be very professional,andThey are SMALL enuf to be very PERSONAL, and to remember you, your car, etc. etc.Great view from the 11th floor pool balcony!Very close to underground shopping, ... everything you could want is in walking distance4 blocks to IGA, 5 blocks to Palace de Congress ... 1 or 2 or 3 blocks to *AWESOME* food ... Easy walk to &quot;Old Town&quot; where the hotel prices are 1.5x to 2x more.Parking is *INDOOR* and the Valet/Concierge is *VERY* *FAST*!!",
8/18/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Excellent service and amenities,"I stayed at the Square Philips for four nights at the end of July 2009. We booked junior suite. This hotel does live up with the standard described on tripavisor. service was excellent as we checked in, one the receptionist who was on its way to leave work came back checked us in. The attention was really apreciated. the rooms are nice, very quiet with a decent bathroom, good choice of TV channels. Concerige and other staffs were truly helpfull during our stay. On the less postive side is the breakfast which is not worth the trip in my opnion, although is free. But all in all, this hotel has allowed us a very enjoyable time in Montreal.",
8/12/2009,can_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Perfect for our purposes,"My husband and I traveled to Montreal for our anniversary and wanted to be in a fairly central location with access to public transportation. We found the Le Square Phillips to be excellent for our purposes. We also enjoyed our late afternoon time on the rooftop deck to relax with some wine. The rooms were spacious and clean with a kitchen. The breakfasts were adequate. Although we weren't able to get much direction from the concierge, we had done homework before hand so it wasn't a big deal. If you are looking for extreme luxury, the Le Square Phillips is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for comfortable, centrally located with access to public transportation, and an inviting spot to watch the city go by, this is the place. We would definitely stay again.",
11/25/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great hotel and location!,"As a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold Member, no upgrade was available at check-in. However, I was provided with complimentary access to the Club Lounge. Upon entering the lounge, when I gave my hotel room number, the attendant called the front desk and was advised I was not eligible. This was rather embarrassing!",
11/23/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great location - sloppy maintenance ,"This hotel is in a great location, very central to everything. My room had an amazing view of the mountain, and the bed was very comfortable. However, the room, despite apparently being recently updated, looked tired. Weird decor &amp; color combinations, and the carpet felt nasty (rough) underfoot, as well as being ugly. If this is a renovation, they should get their money back. No mini-fridge in the room. Housekeeping was sloppy and erratic - one day, wet towels were left on the side of the tub. Another day, a towel and a dust rag were left in the room. My ice bucket (full of melted ice in the morning) was not emptied out on two days. Sometimes I got new tea bags, other days I didn't get new tea bags. Someone else's room service cart with leftover food was left sitting outside my room for most of a day. The pop machine on my floor was out of order the day I arrived, and it had not been fixed when I left, 7 days later..... The front desk folks were very helpful and friendly, but I was not impressed with the overall maintenance and housekeeping. Food at this hotel was generally good, but one day they served Montreal bagels for our conference - they were yesterday's bagels and they were stale/hard. The local Montreal folks were mortified. Considering how much everything cost at this hotel, you would think they could get fresh bagels that morning. The meeting rooms were nice - it was a good hotel for this conference, but I would not likely stay here if it wasn't the conference hotel.",
11/20/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Decent weekend at the Sheraton,"My husband and I stayed here with our 9 month old for a weekend. We used Starwood points for our stay and booked a room on the club floor. A few days before our stay, we got an email offering an upgrade to a suite for just $20.00/night, so of course we took advantage of this. When traveling with a baby, the more space the better. We got a really nice suite on the club floor. It was basically 2 rooms with an open door between them. One of the rooms was set up as a bedroom and the other was a living room. The club lounge had amazing views of the city and was a nice place to start off the day for breakfast or unwind for a drink and some snacks after a long day of sightseeing. The breakfast was fine - the typical things you'd find in a continental breakfast buffet. At night, though, it was not the best selection of food - mozzarella sticks that had stayed out too long, or were stale, and some other odd choices. But it was free, so who can complain?! The alcoholic drinks, however, were not free, and you can expect to pay typical hotel prices for these. The location was good, right in the middle of everything in the Downtown area. We ordered room service, and it was exactly what you'd expect from room service, but was not disappointing.All in all, it was a good stay with no complaints, and we would definitely stay here again.",
11/10/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,great renovations,"Living just south of the Canadian border in Upstate New York, my wife and I from time to time go to Montreal for a nice getaway. Years ago, when the Expos were there, I started staying at the Sheraton because all the visiting baseball teams stayed there. As the years passed, it just so happend that I stayed at other hotels, sometimes because they were the sites of conferences I was attending. I kind of forgot about the Sheraton. I had noticed in driving by the hotel that the lobby had been redone but had not gone inside to take a look. Last week, we went to dinner in Montreal and stayed the night. We decided to stay at the Sheraton and we were very glad we did. They have done a wonderful job on renovating the hotel, particularly the lobby. The front of the hotel on Rue Rene Levesque is glass sided for the first two stories. Under the previous arrangement, guests did not get to experience how spectacular this could be. The bar was tucked off on the side in a windowless area. It has now been moved to the front of the lobby. Anyone sitting at the bar or at tables or sofas throughout this area is in for a treat. My wife and I had a drink and finger foods while sitting on a sofa and just people watched pedestrians going by. The tables have wing-backed chairs and are also very pleasant (We had a nightcap there after dinner.) Lest I concentrate too much on the lobby bar, the entire hotel has been spiffed up. Our room was a good size and since we are members of the Starwood Preferre Guest program, we were placed on a separate floor. I don't precisely how this affected our room amenities, but the room was nice. The Sheraton has always had a great location, close by everything downtown yet just out of the way of the hub bub of St. Catherine Street. The Bonaventure (Hilton) and Chateau Champlain (Marriott) are lovely hotels but they are just slightly out of the way and down a short incline from most of downtown. If you have not been to the Sheraton in a while, I think it would be worth it to check out the changes, particularly if you can get a good rate.",
11/8/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Excellent weekend getaway,"Over Thanksgiving weekend, I decided last minute to head to Montreal, and thought I'd try out the Centre Sheraton. Now I've been in it before, though I had heard that the whole hotel had been recently renovated and so I looked forward to seeing what it had to (newly) offer. Not only was I surprised, but my expectations were surpassed. Here's a breakdown of the stay:Parking and Check in: Check in was quick, efficient, and the front desk worker was very efficient and friendly. I've stayed at many hotels in Montreal, and I can say that this one had the best value (under 20$) for parking costs, and with it being at a central location, I was impressed. The room:I had booked a Deluxe room and was put on one of the top SPG floors. The Deluxe room was probably about 10$ more than the standard room, but had a full sized couch (also a pull-out) so I thought it was worth it. The website still has some pictures from before the entire hotel being renovated, but the room was larger than most, comfortable bed, LCD television, and what was interesting was that it was wired and set up that you could connect media from your laptop directly to the TV, as well as a USB connector (I was able to charge my iPod with its cord without needing an adapter to plug it into the wall)I was pretty sure that each room would come with an MP3 dock, but apparently that's only on the Club rooms (for now). The bathroom was also nicely updated!I saw the pool and gym briefly, though didn't use them. They looked decent, though. I definitely would recommend staying at the Centre Sheraton for a GREAT value, it's RIGHT NEXT to the Bell Centre if there's a game or concert you want to check out. You'll be glad you did!",
11/7/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great location service and value,"As someone who spent five years living in Montreal, I knew what I needed for this trip. Looked online and found this hotel for a great deal! $120 CAD a night, including all taxes. Can't go wrong. The hotel is centrally located, an easy walk from the train station. We were heading to the hockey game, and this hotel is ACROSS THE STREET. Great hotel, really really quiet. Can't say that we used any of the amenities of the hotel, or even the service per se, but it was a great stay all around. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
11/7/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Perfect place for a nice weekend in town,"Very nice staff, they where very helpfull in planing our weekend ( museum and activity for the little one). Food a bit pricy but so many good restaurant around. The room was perfect. And the pool-sauna area is really nice and quiet.",
10/30/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Amazing hotel with amazing customer service...,"Arrived in the morning and was able to check in without any trouble. Excellent customer service as I was attended to almost instantly after walking through the turn-about entrance.We received a corner room with facing west, with views of Mont-Royal. The room was clean and comfortable with a large LCD TV. This hotel is within walking distance to the metro station and within walking distance to great nightlife and shopping.",
10/26/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great Stay But....,"Good location, good staff, nice room but no restaurant in the hotel for evening meals if you have children. If you have children you are directed to the &quot;family&quot; area which is three small tables, basically in the lobby. I would not have stayed there if I had known this. Of course, room service was available.",
10/26/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great hotel great location.,"Very nice hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal. I've stayed at pretty much all the four star properties in the downtown area (Fairmont, Marriott Chateau Champlain, etc) and I think this one is the nicest. While it's not connected directly to the metro like the Fairmont, Hilton and Marriott it does have a great location convenient to nightlife, restaurants, St. Catherine's, etc. The rooms though can't be beat. They've been very recently updated, great furnishings, huge LCD TV, giant granite and slate bathroom and some of the most comfortable bedding you'll sleep on in a hotel. Rooms are very clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was conveniently in the hotel and was average price ($20 CAD). Didn't try the restaurant but the bar did look VERY nice. I think this may be my new go-to place in Montreal.",
10/16/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,How wonderful the hotel and its staff!!!,"Hi, My name is Tsering and I would like to share this wonderful experience of me and my siblings who stayed at your hotel for three nights.When we first arrived the gentlemen at the front desk took great care of us and we had no problems checking in.The check-in was fast and professional.The moment we enter our room it gives us feel at home, we requested for a fridge prior to our arrival and it was there. The room was spotlessly clean and smells fresh.What we like the most is the swimming pool which is so well maintained and also the design and deepness of the pool is perfect for all guest, no matter it is for kid as the level of deepness is not that deep so we really enjoyed swimming in your pool.The location was the prime reason we choose your hotel because we came to attend His Holiness The Dalai Lama's public talk which held at the Bell Centre and it was just a walking distance. Overall our experiences in your hotel is so memorable and whenever we drop in Montreal in near future we will definitely stay at your hotel.",
10/14/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Perfect stay!,"This hotel was in the perfect spot, handy to everything we wanted to see. It was very clean and the staff was always cleaning something-the hallways or rooms. The rooms were very quiet and relaxing along with really comfy beds! The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. We would definately stay here again!",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Wonderful Find at a Very Terrific Price,"I booked the Sheraton Le Centre Montreal Hotel with minimal expectations, primarily due to paying less than $100 for the 1 night room on Hotwire. However, my girlfriend and I exceedingly impressed with the property due to many factors, including its terrific located (central to both Old Montreal and Mont Royal), modernly designed guest rooms, FREE wi-fi for your laptop, reasonably priced parking ($20 CAD/night) a nice pool and exercise facility, and overall staff curteousness. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat and was very pleased with our stay.",
10/8/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Stay for the beds!,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was recently renovated and comfortable. The bed was the best! Hotel is located downtown near shopping, but it's easy to get around using the metro or the BIXI bike share.",
9/28/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great stay,Very nice stay at the Sheraton in downtown Montreal. Got a room on the 9th floor. A little smaller than what I'm used to but very comfortable. Love those pillows !!Putting the ice machines next to the service elevator is weird. It's not a part of the hotel that guests should have to see.Nice pool and hot tub.This is a great downtown location. Can't miss.,
9/27/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,A nice romantic getaway,"We decided to enjoy a &quot;staycation&quot; of sorts by travelling from Ottawa to Montreal instead of heading down south to an all -inclusive for our second wedding anniversary. We decided to try the Sheraton downtown Montreal as we have stayed at the Sheraton in other cities and enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival I mentioned that I was a Gold Member and received a complimentary upgrade to the 30th floor, a King room, with a gorgeous view of Montreal and Mont-Royal - perfect for watching the sunset. The room was recently renovated, luxurious bedding, very clean and modern decor. The room was quiet, we managed to sleep in until at least 9am every day, no late night or early morning interruptions. My only complaint would be the lack of a mini-fridge in the room. As we were staying multiple nights it would have been nice to be able to stock some cold beverages &amp; snacks. The hotel was walking distance to Old Montreal, Mont-Royal &amp; St-Catharines street.",
9/15/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Luxury at The Sheraton,"We took a short break (Monday to Friday) whilst visiting family in Toronto. We arrived at the hotel on foot from the VIA rail station which is just a short (4-5 minute) walk away and walked up to reception, handed them my email booking and they handed me my room key after recording the details of the credit card. Took all of 3 minutes and we were on our way up to 34th floor in a high speed lift. Amazingly quick check in and despatch to our room. We were in room 3421 and it was a corner Club room. We opened the door and gasped with pleasure. The room was beautiful, modern and spacious. The wardrobe was plenty big enough and the marble bathroom was large as well. The shower was very good and the toiletries provided were first class and replenished daily. Plenty of towels as well including face cloths. There was a hair dryer and a safe in the wardrobe. There was an easy chair, a desk, internet access and this huge TV. The decoration of the room was great and very comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable and adorned with 4 huge soft pillows. The room was cleaned expertly daily and the staff very courteous and smiled a lot. The Club Room on 37th Floor was fabulous as well and the staff there again were smiling and helpful. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and replenished continuously. Fresh coffee ground coffee as well. The hors d'oeurves from 5 pm were a bonus too if you didn't want to eat until late as well and quite a variety as well. The bar on the ground floor was lively as this was also a conference hotel but that did not interfere with us in any way at all, I was worried that the club room might get too busy for us to find a seat, but that was never the case. There was a nice pool, whirlpool, sauna and outside sun area on 6th floor which was never crowded and always clean. The only fault that I could find with this hotel, and I am digging deep here, was that there was no mirror over the desk so drying my hair in comfort was a little awkward and I would have liked a flatter pillow as I have neck problems (told you I was digging deep). Checkout was just as simple as check in and no queues. The concierge was fine as well, but we only used her once and she came up with what we asked for. We were a 30 minute walk from Old Montreal and St Catherine Street with all the shopping was just behind the hotel. Metro and VIA rails station all close by. All in all, I highly recommend ia stay at this hotel if you like polite, discrete, friendly professional staff and a great room with a great view and Club facilities. Worth every penny! Oh, another unexpected bonus, we caught the end of the film festival and were treated to an expert outdoor display of acrobatics, music and other activities absolutely free!",
9/13/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Beautiful rooms terrible service,"My spouse and I stayed at this property for two nights for a little getaway. We had booked this room as a reward stay for one night and a regular rate for the following night. Even before we arrived there were problems with our reservation. The information on the reservations was incorrect and they had us booked in two rooms for one night. It was a good thing I called to ensure that everything was correct before we arrived. That was strike one.When you arrive at this property it looks like any other nicely maintained large scale hotel; large lobby, large lounge and restaurant area, connections to shopping areas etc. The check in process was fine but I felt that the staff were not very polite. There were two conventions in the hotel while we were there so I can understand that the staff may have been rushed/tired etc., but first impressions and customer service count for a great deal, so suck it up.Since I'm an SPG member I was upgraded to the SPG (31st) floor of the hotel. The room was spacious with beautiful linens and a lovely view of downtown Montreal and Mount Royal. The money that the Sheraton chain spent on their worldwide reservations has been a good investment as the room are really quite nice.My issue with our stay was the service we received. As part of the renovations each room in the hotel now has a nice flat screen television with an area that allow HDMI and VGA hookups from your laptop to the television. Since we prefer the Starwood group of hotels we were aware that most properties have this feature and brought proper cables along to watch movies from our laptop on the television. We had problems getting the audio function of this interface to work and called to front desk for some help. After about 20 minutes a general maintenance worker came to our room and tried to 'fix' the problem. I get that not everyone knows how this type of interface works but do not send someone without the proper expertise to fix the issue! We never did get that problem resolved. It's also probably good for me to point out that the tv, while capable of producing a high definition picture, is not connected to any high definition channels.My second issue was the extremely early knock on the door that I got for the delivery of our hotel bills and the lack of coordination with our hotel reservations. Since one night was a reward stay and the other was a regular rate stay the hotel kept these as separate folios, so I got separate invoices, even though I expressly asked for them to be combined both when calling in advance of our arrival and upon arrival. Now in most hotels that we have visited, and we have stayed in many worldwide, your invoice arrives in the middle of the night, typically slid under the door. At this property, however, the staff felt it necessary to knock on our door and wake us for the delivery of this invoice at 7:50 am on a Saturday. Now I know that for the early riser this may not be that great of an inconvenience, but this was supposed to be a romantic getaway where we could sleep late and do things at our own pace. In addition to this inconvenience, we were awoken again an hour later by housekeeping and were harassed an additional time in the morning by housekeeping again even though we had a 'do not disturb' sign on our door. I would like to note that this same early morning knock on the door with the bill and the early housekeeping arrival happened again on the second morning.As part of our getaway we wanted to take in some of the sights and attractions that Montreal has to offer. We called the concierge and learned that the hotel carried discount tickets to the Biodome. We indicated that we were going to pick up some tickets and that we were coming right down. When we arrived at the concierge's desk, no one was there and we encountered the third issue with this stay. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up and help us. We spoke to the bell captain and another lady who both said that there was nothing that they could do to assist and that we would have to wait. I understand that staff are entitled to breaks and such, but if you know you are going to be away for more than a few minutes, leave a sign or some indication of when you will return. When the concierge returned we told him that we were waiting for a while and he brushed us off stating that he had 'other stuff to do' and that's why he wasn't available. Not a good excuse when your sole function is to provide guests with a service.Our fourth problem with this stay reared its head when we arrived back at the hotel that afternoon. Our keys did not work on our room door any longer. Since our reservations were not amalgamated, like I requested twice before, our keys' functionality expired and we had to get them re-magnetized. On its own, this would have been a mild hindrance, but it was just adding to the other annoyances we had already experienced.Our fifth problem was our final bill. Since the reservations were not amalgamated we were charged incorrectly for certain items, namely internet and parking. We were charged double for the internet and charged for valet parking, even though we used the self park option. I had to call the hotel after we left to confirm that the extra charges were removed. (An aside on self parking vs valet: use the self park and save a few bucks as the valet and self park are all housed in the same parking structure that is part of the hotel.)Needless to say, our experience was really soured by this lack of good service. This hotel really ends up giving the Starwood chain a bad name in Montreal. We will not be staying here again. If you are looking for a beautiful room with bad service, this is the hotel for you.",
9/12/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Couldn't ask for a nicer hotel!,"My husband, myself and another couple just returned from a three night stay at the Le Centre. Our room was immaculate, very comfortable and had a beautiful view of the city from the 28th floor. The room had plenty of space to put away a lot of clothes ( I don't travel light). Although there was a charge for internet in the room we had no trouble connecting in the public spaces. Breakfast in the restaurant was served promptly, we never had to wait for a table, and offered an extensive menu with lots of healthy choices.The concierge was very helpful and suggested a lovely bistro (Laloux).The day after we checked out we discovered we had left an expensive new purchase in the room. To our amazement the housekeeping staff had promptly turned it in and the hotel Federal Expressed it to us within a day of arriving home.",
9/10/2009,can_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Terrible Experience,"We were given room 3621, a room on the last Club Room VIP floor, and the room was so noisy we woke up at 2:00 am and called to get the room changed to another one on the 35TH floor which had less noise. Anyway they told us that the mechanical room was righ on top. MY question is: Why don't they fix it?",
11/22/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great Hotel Experience,"My husband and I traveled to Old Montreal for a 4 day get-away. The hotel was beautiful. It is decorated in a trendy, urban chic décor. It is very clean, and the staff was polite and helpful. My husband and I are frequent travelers; we look to stay in the nicest hotels available. There is curbside valet parking for all guests; and concierge service around the clock. We received complimentary wine every night on the roof top lounge, and a free truly continental breakfast daily with wonderful croissants, rich coffee, and fruit and chocolate. Old Montreal is decidedly European with most staff speaking multiple languages including English, French and Spanish.The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal and walking is a must. This hotel is located a block from the Note Dame Basilica, The historic waterfront, museums, shopping and restaurants.My one suggestion is not to stay on the top floor, as the rooftop bar and restaurant are noisy well past midnight, and the staff is up there cleaning and moving chairs and tables very early!",
11/19/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Hotel Nelligan,"In recent visit to Montreal to attend the IDF congress at the Palais Congress, stayed at the Nelligan in Old Montreal. Really enjoyed this hotel. Firstly, it was a great location- within walking distance of the Palais Congress (where the metro station is located as well). Room was great- spacious, tastefully decorated. Staff very efficient and friendly. Plently of restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommended.",
11/4/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Charming and chic.,"Excellent location in Old Montreal. Staff was friendly and most helpful with any special request. The morning breakfast buffet is really nice and much more than a continental breakfast. Rooms are a bit dark but ultra modern and comfortable. Free WIFI is a plus, too. Hotel is also near several excellent french restaurants. The concierge helped us with reservations and the meals were wonderful. The hotel also caters to groups with meeting rooms and other functions so it's a bit busier than the traditional boutique hotels.",
11/1/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great location comfy room,"Loved Hotel Nelligan! Boutique hotel in a great location in Old Montreal. Bed was super comfy, nice amenities, although the bathroom lighting was a little dark. Wine happy hour each night was nice, and Jean the concierge rocked! She really hooked us up at some great restaurants -- Restaurant Toque!, the Globe (for people-watching). Some people say it is noisy - but I thought it was super quiet, no problem with noise. Would definitely go back.",
10/19/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Delightful stay in Vieux-Montreal,"We stayed at Hotel Nelligan for six nights during a vacation to Montreal. We chose a 'King Loft' room. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was huge and spotless. (In fact, my husband took notes on the shower design for our next household renovation!) The style of hotel itself is trendy without being pretentious. The staff was attentive, friendly, very helpful with directions, and restaurant recommendations. The location is central to the old scenic part of the city, but not right in the middle of the bustle of the main tourist drags. We were in easy walking distance of Notre Dame and many cafes and galleries. I would stay at the Nelligan again on any visit to Montreal.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Charming hotel that I would return to again and again.,"Hotel Nelligan is located in the Old City of Montreal. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were elegant, comfortable and clean. I had a small issue with the location of the TV compared to the bed but it could certainly be overlooked. Morning breakfast was delicious and complementary evening wine and cheese was a delight. Highly recommended for couples, business or leisure. Not handicapped accessible but neither was anything else on the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal.",
9/29/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Gorgeous hotel excellent location in the old town,"This hotel was lovely, really well put together. Downside was that the whirlpool bath didn't work and was't fixed while we were there despite highlighting it twice. We were offered a room change the second time, but it was our last night so we didn't bother. When we mentioned this at check out they offered to wave the phone charges on the room ($10) with abit more pushing they only charged us for a basic room which was fine, but should have been their first offer in my opinion. Other than that a lovely experience. The continental breakfast had everything you would expect and the bagels were particularly good. We ate at the restaurant and it was pretty nice, food and service wer excellent, we would go there again.",
9/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Totally satisfied!,I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Nelligan. It was more than I expected! Everyone was friendly &amp; more than helpful. It had a very warm ambiance &amp; I felt so comfortable.We had a double room &amp; it was very tastefully decorated. We were facing the street &amp; there was never a problem with noise. The bathroom was spacious &amp; the products were heavenly!I would not hesitate to stay here again!,
9/9/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,An enchanting time in Old Montreal at the Hotel Nelligan,"If you're looking for a romantic hotel in Old Montreal (the historic center of the city) with a bit of boutique hipness and Euro style to it, Hotel Nelligan is a great choice. There's a reason why Hotel Nelligan consistently scores the highest marks on Trip Advisor and gets rave reviews in travel magazines -- every aspect of our stay was fantastic, from the romantic rooms to the sky terrace to the service. Best of all, the hotel is located on a cobblestone, very European-feeling street, close by to some of the city's main tourist attractions. That being said, the hotel didn't feel &quot;touristy&quot; at all. The name of the hotel comes from Emile Nelligan, a famous Quebec poet, and there are constant reminders about Ms. Nelligan throughout the hotel. Three great restaurant locations are attached to the hotel as well - Verses, Sky Terrace and Mechant Boeuf Brasserie (order the poutine!).",
9/6/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great stay despite some service issues,"Reviews here and on other sites accurately reflected our experience at the Nelligan. For a boutique hotel in a historic district, the Nelligan was very comfortable, quiet, and had nice charm. Many personal touches make this property seem like a great value in retrospect -- nightly wine and cheese hour, daily cont. breakfast, great bath amenities, fabulous bedding, etc. The downsides here were service-oriented and the issues we experienced seemed consistent with those expressed by other reviewers here. It was disappointing given we enjoyed the hotel so much but had to be patient with some issues that other hotels nail as a given at this price level. The few, basic inquiries we made of the staff were hit or miss on execution. Here are some examples: - We called down for ice on three occassions and it never showed up, so we just stopped calling....yet, other requests like wake-up calls were fine.- Upon our arrival with baggage, the bell staff (several of them) just stood around talking to each other and other guests, and ignored us as we struggled with getting in the front doors.....yet, at other times, bell staff went beyond the call to locate taxis for us down the street.- The rooftop terrace was a fantastic way to spend a sunset, which we did on each night, and loved it, but the service was horrendous to the point it became a comedy. They knew how to make only the drinks on the menu, and any request beyond that was literally discouraged by the waitresses (&quot;oh, the bartenders probably don't even know what that is, can you just choose something off the menu&quot;). While the wine list offered some nice glasses of wine at $10 to $20 a glass, one of the many glasses we ordered came corked and rancid smelling. We politely asked for a replacement glass, and the waitress wanted to have a long debate with us on the matter and try and convince us it was fine.- there appeared to be no service elevator at the hotel because day and night, the staff was shuttling push carts of food and housekeeping in and out of the elevators, cramming in with unsuspecting hotel guests. It made waits for the elevators noticibly long and frequently cramped; by day two we just started taking the stairs to avoid the hassle.- housekeeping in general in our room was very basic and inconsistent; only once did they actually seem to clean the room with cleaning products; most days, they simply made the bed and replaced towels, leaving dirty drinking glasses as they were, and surfaces hadn't been wiped down. All this said, for the few but memorable downsides, the place was really comfortable, well appointed, a solid value, and charming. We'd stay here again and recommend it to our friends without hesitation. Just be prepared for a little hit or miss service. I really hope the management will make some improvements.",
9/5/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Love this hotel,"Beautiful rooms, extremely friendly and helpful staff. Great location and atmosphere. Old Montreal is fabulous. I plan to come back with my husband for a romantic getaway!",
8/31/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Cozy relaxing and perfect location!,"My wife wanted a unique hotel with loads of character to spend our honemoon. Old Monteral was our destination and after some exhaustive research online she found Hotel Nelligan. We went in with very high exopectations based on reviews both here and in Fodor's. We were not dissappointed!The room was spotless, bed was very comfortable, the electric fireplace was nice touch (although slightly tacky in a Wal-Mart kind of way) and the staff was perfect. The brick walls were amazing and mostly soundproof. Our room was looking out onto the alley and wasn't that bad. I mean really, front, back atruim or alley, all windows in Old Montreal look right at the next building anyway.The location was a 5 minute walk to the Metro and there must be 30 restaurants/coffee shops/cafes or more within that radius. We went to 4 of each during our stay and review them elsewhere. We didn't take our car out of the Valet parking for all 4 days,Nelligan is afilliated with Rainspa in Place D'Armes Hotel and they arranged for 2 spa treament there for us which were very nice. We will definitely return to Hotel Nelligan in the Ffuture and will recommend it highly to any one who asks.",
8/29/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Excellent spacious room- go to Place d'Armes for the wine and cheese,"We stayed in Rm. 303 for two nights. The room was spacious and quiet though facing the street, had a king bed, luxurious bathrobes, a fireplace you can turn on even in the summer as it throws off no heat., and jacuzzi- I gasped when my husband showed me the bathroom. It was a very comfortable room seeing as it was so muggy outside. it doesn't cost much more than an average hotel for all this elegance.You can go to the Place D'Armes, their sister hotel, for the wine and cheese reception each night- the wine is better and the presentation of the cheese, fruit and bread is much nicer; you just show your ticket.I think this would be a very nice romantic hotel for a honeymoon!",
8/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,WONDERFUL,"Where do I begin from the momentwe arrived it was all about the service. Attentive,warm and friendly. The room was spacious and well appointed. Clean more then comfortable. The continental breakfast was well done and plentiful. I would definitely stay here again and again 5 thumbs up",
8/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Great Hotel in Old Montreal,"I just returned from a one night stay at the Hotel Nelligan.It is well located in the heart of Old Montreal. It is very close to great restaurants and art galleries.My room was very quiet, and the bed comfy. The hotel is very clean, although the carpets on the guest floors are slighly worn. The gym, although small has a nice selection of weights and cardio. My room was large, with a nice shower and jacuzzi. My room was very quiet. The hotel price is very competitive to other hotels in Montreal that I have stayed in, although the Hotel Nelligan has far more atmosphere and charm than the average downtown high rise hotel. The complimentary wine and cheese was excellent, with the staff and other guests very friendly. The breakfast in the morning was okay, although nothing special, as it had the usual selection of bread and cereal, and the coffee was slightly cold. Hotel staff was efficient, and as a repeat customer I recieved a nice note and three tasty cookies. In all, a great and relaxing night in Old Montreal.",
8/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Perfect,"Beautiful rooms, wonderful service, perfect location",
8/13/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Shame about the service,"What a great hotel. Brilliant location near the old town centre. However we were very disappointed with the service. The maid service was slow. One day we had left the room very early and stayed out for more than 5 hours. when we returned, to get out of the blazing sun and have a rest our room had not bee made up. We asked if it could be made up and were told this would happen immediately. We waited in the bar for 30 mins and when my husband went to check if it had been done, they had not even started it. Another one hour later we were still sitting there, buying drinks from their bar ofcourse.We were just so disappointed as this was meant to be out finest hotel on our long trip. They didn't even apologize afetr the event. After checking out they didn't even ask if we had enjoyed our stay. The front of house staff were a bit rude. What a shame!!",
8/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,C'est Magique!,A group of 6 girls stayed at this beautiful hotel in Old Montreal. The staff was wonderful. The complimentary wine and cheese and breakfast were a lovely touch. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. The rooftop restaurant was fabulous as was our waiter Joe and bartender Jimmy! What a view and an outstanding burger!Thanks for a great stay!,
8/5/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,A well orchestrated tourist trap...American Travellors Beware!!!!,We stayed at the Nelligan in Montreal on your recommendation. The first night there after a day of travel the hot tub kept going on and off all night. Sleep was impossible. There were no towels. Lights were burned out in the room and no one would fix them...The room could not be properly cooled. There was no manager at night and the 2 young guys who were there at just started at the place. All they could do was shrug their shoulders. The wireless internet did not work but eventually I could hook up with ethernet. The manager (Kevin) the next day got the tub fixed but not after much coaxing and that is all that was done. By the last day we got some lights fixed. The front desk girls were rude and disconnected. The adjustment on the bill was $50.00. If this is a luxury 5 star hotel you have reset the bar just above the ground. It is a tourist trap. Warn your consumers or get yourselves off the market as a service to others that will get trapped like us.,
8/1/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_nelligan,Could not find fault with this establishment,"This was simply a very good experience all round.Hotel comfortable, staff efficient and friendly and definitely not in your face.Definitely worth a visit.",
11/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location View Service,"The hotel itself is elegant. First class lobby that looked really nice. The bar was not quite right (bad drinks, service, nobody there). The indoor / outdoor pool they have is great for lounging. The rooms were very spacious. Lots of room to spread out. The beds were only OK for a room this big and nice. The views of the city and surrounding area were just awesome. The service was great, we ordered room service twice and it was fast and good both times.",
11/4/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location!,"This hotel was located in the heart of downtown Montreal only a few blocks from Eaton Centre and Crescent Street. Close to everything, including the metro. Hotel staff is great. Ramzi Ben Mansour, head of the loyalty program, does an excellent job accommodating guests. The concierge had several maps of downtown Montreal along with menus of the restaurants in the area. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at the Omni, and I would definitely stay here when in Montreal again.Traveler's tip on getting the most out of your stay: Make sure you sign up for the Omni Select-Guest loyalty program at the Omni website prior to checking in. You’ll get free wireless internet access and complimentary drinks for breakfast delivered every morning to your room.",
11/4/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Location Location Location. Omni standards do not go past the lobby.,"The location was convenient to shooping, restaurants and a short climb to Mont Royal's summit (a must see). Staff at Omni Mont Royal were gracious and helpful. Valet parking was reasonable and convenient. The currency exchange was pricey--better off going to a bank. Lobby and small bar/restaurant were attractive and well-maintained. But be prepared to pay more taxes than you thought possible on drinks at the bar--causing an $8 beer cost about $12. Website advertised two in-house restaurants--but we never found a second. This was a former Four Seasons Hotel, but you will be underwhelmed if you are expecting grandeur.Guestrooms were shabby and rather dusty for $160/night (which was the advertised rate) thankfully we didn't pay that much. Even the bathroom was dusty. Room was an average size. Carpet was old and buckling, making it a tripping hazard. No flat screen TV's here. Pillows were the best part of the room. Gym and pool area were dated but comfortable and adequate. No high tech equipment but you could get a full workout using free weights and Universal Machine. Treadmills were old but why use a treadmill when you can run on the mountain trails up the road?! Hotel has a small spa that we did not use. The hotel has a small boutique with great evening wear if you are shopping for an occassion--but there are hundreds of other stores in the neighborhood--street level and underground.",
11/3/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Location - Needs a renovation,"I booked this on priceline. Was a little worried when I saw the photos. All in all not a bad hotel. Room was large though extremely dated ( Floral curatins, CRT TV , asbestos ceiling - all very 80s). I also experienced a lot of noise from the street. Location is unbeatable to main city centre and shops. For the price I paid it was OK - but I would not pay the direct online price. Solid 3.5 star for me.",
11/3/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,OMNI Mont-Royal - Amazing!,"Just returned from my business trip (with my wife also) and found the OMNI Mont-Royal to be an amazing hotel - We will be returning again and again. (check my other reviews I am not easy to impress) From the location, the Staff who greeted us, the Room and the Dinning everything was perfect! This is the level of perfection which all other hotels should attempt to reach. If you are going to Montreal you have to stay here!",
10/24/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Central bit dated but exceptionally clean,"We stayed here for three nights. The room was large and comfortable. The decor was dated -floral, swagged curtains and valances - but it looked literally brand new because it was so exceptionally clean and well cared for, as was the bathroom.The hotel is very central in Montreal. In one way for us this was a bad thing because it is a fair walk (but certainly walkable) to get to either the old town or the plateau, which were the places we liked the best. It is only a short taxi ride, though. Also, it is convenient for the shops, business district, and the park and university.The pool is outdoors and was well heated and usable in October. I think they may close it in winter so if you want to swim you should check.Overall we liked the hotel and would recommend it.",
10/15/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Well priced renovation will make it 5 stars,"The Omni Mont-Royal was a nice hotel priced properly in recognition for its need of an update to make it a real luxury hotel. As usual, this hotel had the extremely comfortable Omni bedding, and the room was a nice-large size. The furnishing, wallpaper, bathrooms, and general decor is dated, but according to management the hotel will be undergoing a renovation/update soon. After this occurs I have no doubt it will be a true luxury hotel, of course they'll be able to charge more as well.Check-in desk was very friendly upon arrival, but concierge service was lacking, to say the least. When we asked for recommendations of places to eat the concierge simply gave us a print out of restaurants in the area, that's all. I think that travelers expect, especially from a self-proclaimed luxury hotel, a little higher quality of service and help from the concierge when providing suggestions to out of town guest. Any person that can do a 15 sec. Internet search could have gotten that list. IMO it is the job of the concierge to give actual recommendations of places in the area that are good, not simply hand the guest a piece of paper w/ names. Having said all that, the concierge was the only blemish on an otherwise great stay at another nice Omni property that is only going to get better.The hotel is centrally located, near Mont-Royal, the museums, McGill university and a 5 min. walk to the old city/port area. Good location.",
10/14/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Spacious room and the perfect location,"Our room was a huge suite, more than we needed, but after reading some reviews about the suites being made over first, we decided to play it safe - with it being our 10th anniversary trip - and the cost uptick being reasonable. On the plus side: The location was stellar. We could walk to eat at many places easily, walk to the &quot;nightclub&quot; strip, but not hear it in our room. The shopping was right around the corner, and so was a hike up Mount Royal. The walk to Old Town is also very do-able. The room was nicely decorated, in a more traditional, older style. Not &quot;sexy,&quot; but nice. The beds and bed linens were wonderful and seemed new. Our double bathrooms were a nice surprise and quite large. A window that opened in the main room was nice. The closets were huge. Overall our stay was very comfortable and it is nice to know that we could go back to that room with another couple, or our children, and still have complete privacy and lots of space. On the negative: We were surprised not to find a fridge in the room, especially considering that it was a suite. We had Internet connectivity problems which created a lot of stress as we needed to tap into our email and mail our Cirque tix to the concierge to print. We were sent through a lot of loops to get help and the technology group we worked with couldn't see any problems with the signal. We wasted a couple hours with that. Then, the next morning, &quot;waa-laa: the signal was back and we got right online.&quot; It remained a mystery. Overall, a great place to stay.",
10/13/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,we were spoiled by Omni Hotel ,"My husband and I just returned from 12 days in Quebec area, and last 4 days in Montreal for a local wedding reception being held for us after our summer wedding in California. When we told the Omni we were attending our wedding reception, they registered us in their loyalty program, upgraded our room to a two room suite with a lovely view of the mountain and city!, and we felt pampered and spoiled the entire visit. Ramzi is their loyalty program director, and he was a prince. The night of our wedding reception my husband had tried to use the nearby parking lot and got lost coming back to the hotel to pick me up, and when Ramzi saw me waiting there, he refused to leave although he was already off duty, until my husband returned eventually and we were off to our reception. I also had medical items that needed refrigeration, and Ramzi got us a fridge for our suite, which helped me enormously. I have dietary needs and one day asked room service if they could toast my own wheat-free bread, which they did cheerfully and delivered to my room in a little basket. The service was perfect from everyone in the hotel, and we found ourselves online looking up where there were other Omni hotels in cities where we travel. I will be back in Montreal at least 2 or 3 times in the coming year, and hope to be able to stay at the Omni again. My only consideration is that we booked through a discount booking site online; I wish the Omni could match the discount booking sites so we could book directly with the hotel. We used hotwire which doesn't show the hotel name until after booking, but perhaps we'll try Priceline as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks Ramzi and Omni for a memorable extended honeymoon stay in Montreal.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,A solid performance from a good city hotel - raves for Omni loyalty program,"My impression of the hotel was driven by the amazing perks granted us by the Omni loyalty program. far from being frequent guests at this small chain, we signed up on line just days before our scheduled stay. The stay was for a friend's wedding and we were given a fair rate of about CAD159, I think. Check in was a breeze with no paperwork as we were &quot;preregistered&quot; as members of the program. Bell men and valet were friendly and efficient. The room was very spacious - I believe we had a King Dlx or something - on a high floor with views up to Mont Royale. There was a desk and table and sofa. Closet space was very good. Plenty of hangers. No mini bar - just a non-functioning refrigerator (used to be the minibar, I was told by the bellman). When informed I needed to keep some medications cold, he quickly ran for ice. It turned out that this was a big help as I would later find that the ice machines on my floor and the next THREE down were out of service. Bed is very comfortable with good sheets. The frequent guest perks continued with the daily pressing of one item of clothing (though there was an inroom iron, if needed). A complimentary bottle of Evian was also provided. And coupons for the delivery of free &quot;Morning beverages&quot; of choice and the offer of adding pastries/toast for a nominal charge. They brought a large pot of coffee and 2 large glasses of OJ and ice water each morning at exactly the time requested. membership also offered free WiFi in the room. The bathroom is fine - though a little dark and the ceiling is rather low, as I recall. I did my makeup in the bedroom area, as a result. The safe operates with a key rather than passcode, which is a little outdated, but fine). I think that a tighter security system would make me feel better about staying here alone in the future. Late one night a very shady character approached as we returned from a late dinner and then proceeded into the hotel, ahead of us, and wandered around the lobby before he spied the elevators and decided to go up. I am certain he was not a guest or even a guest of a guest- but there was no one in the valet area or front desk to report him to or to question him. A bit disconcerting. We had a drink in the bar on our way out on Friday night. I didn't think that the barstaff had the usual sense of spirit one might expect at a big city hotel watering hole. They were a little slow and disinterested. Overall, however, staff was uniformly courteous and housekeepers were friendly and cautious (no propped open doors, etc.). The pool area is quite nice and well protected from the breeze and the indoor/outdoor hot tub area was amusing. Amerispa (separate management) is the spa located in the lower level of the hotel. I had 3 different treatments here and all were good - though at the end of my facial, she tried to sell me more than $600 worth of creams with dire admonitions about the aging process - never a nice way to end a relaxing 3-hours. And that's all. Check out was easy. The location is fantastic - and there is an entrance to the underground city from directly under the hotel - which would be great for a winter weather trip. We would definitely consider staying next time we are in town and preferred it to the Sheraton, where we stayed a few years ago.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great location large rooms could use a rejuvenation.,"We stayed at the Omni for 4 nights. This hotel's greatest quality is it's location- plenty of excellent restaurants, shopping, and museums within walking distance. Try Chandelier for pizza- gorgeous inside and 2 for 1 gourmet pizzas while we were there. We stopped by a couple times! Easy walk to St. Catherine shopping. The hotel itself is not necessarily of the quality we've come to expect from domestic Omnis. The lobby is small, although welcoming. The rooms show their age, but are larger than you would expect. With a little facelift, this could be a great hotel. The service we'd received at other Omni locations was also lacking here. Usually the staff is falling over each other to make every attempt to make your stay enjoyable, well above average. The service at Mt. Royal was average, typical hotel quality. As an example, as part of their loyalty program, we received coupons for free pressings, but their pressing machine was out of order all 4 days of our visit. No attempt was made to find us an alternative. Overall, the location was excellent for a pedestrian, and if I were planning the same trip, I'd probably go back.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Not a Five Star!,"I was very dissapointed with the Omni Mont Royal. I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway with a few of my friends (some of which stayed at other hotels nearly - which were cheaper and much more comfortable) and was very dissapointed when i got to the front counter and was advised we were given a room with 2 twin beds. I had booked 2 double beds (they said i had booked for 1 person only ) and was advised that due to many hotel guests changing their bookings last minute that all they had left were either 2 twin beds or 1 king bed. Even though we each got our own bed, i was definitely not impressed that a five star would even offer twin beds?! The comfort level of sleeping in a twin bed is nowhere near that of a double or even queen. I had read some of the reviews before i had gone and have to agree that the Omni needs a major facelift. The staff at the counter was very friendly as was the bellhop and valet. We had a great view of Montreal but that was about it. i would not recommend this hotel until they renovate it.",
9/19/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Good Value - well located,"We stayed here for 2 days. The young girl who checked us in was very pleasant - though we have to say other receptionists were quite dismissive when we asked for change.Girl on conciege desk was very helpful as was the young man - though others were not and allowed people to skip ahead of me in the queue. One of the bellhops was topnotch in giving advice and even came into the lobby to help.The room was on the 24th floor and had great views over the city, it was clean and pleasant - I was a bit worried about other reviews of shabby rooms - but ours was nice if a little outdated . Linen could do with replacing though. The staff forgot to replace feather pillowa, but this was done quite promptly.The car parking was not great, with queues waiting to drop off luggage, you can park your own car without having to pay valet costs. Though we felt that some of the valet staff were keen to fetch our car and not too happy when we declined.Overall I would recommend the Omni for location and general good standard.",
9/12/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Pleasant Hotel in a Great Location with some Minor Flaws,"I booked my ticket on Priceline for around $100/night which, for the location, is pretty good. The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous, though the entrance is a bit hectic and chaotic. There is a parking garage on the adjacent block which was a trick to find, but since Montreal has a good transit system we were able to leave the car there the entire weekend. The room was a bit aged but clean for the most part. It did smell a bit of smoke, so next time I will definitely ask for a non-smoking room. On the back of the bathroom door we found the previous guest's shorts and panties on the hook - apparently they had forgotten them and housekeeping missed them. The room and bathroom were clean though and that was the only flaw I could find. We were on the 29th floor and the view was wonderful. The bed was comfortable, the room decently sized, and the bathroom was quite nice overall. Plenty of hot water and water pressure. The location is only two blocks from the bustling St. Catherine Street.. and only one block from the nearest Metro station. It's also close to the Parc Mont Royal which offers spectacular views of Montreal and plenty of walking and hiking trails. It is also close to McGill University. For these reasons, I don't think you can get much better in terms of location. I did not try the restaurant or the bar in the hotel. I did use the gym, and it was actually quite large compared to other hotel gyms I've used. It had plenty of free weights, machines, and towels - I was very pleased. The pool was very nice and clean too, and neither were very busy when I used them. The gym was actually empty on one occasion.There was also free high-speed internet. Overall, I did enjoy my stay in the hotel. Despite some flaws, I would stay here again, as the price was reasonable and the service friendly. I would recommend this hotel to others, though I would definitely not pay more than what I paid for on Priceline.",
9/12/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,What a surprisingly delightful stay!,My wife and I just left the Omni Hotel in Montreal and were very sorry to have to leave. To say we were treated like we were family is an understatement. We were treated so well it was a shock! From the registration personal to the service employees we had a stellar experience. The staff knew the city well and gave us excellent advice both on directions to the sights and to incredible restaurants. The location of the hotel was central to all of the places we wanted to see and the metro was just a block away. We are travelers. We have been in many places all over the world. The Omni ranks at the top of our experiences. Thank you for such a pleasent time in your city!,
9/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Good hotel in downtown Montreal,"We stayed on the 4th floor adjacent the elevator, which proved quite noisy throughout the night as people returned to their rooms.The room was of a decent size with good wardrobe/storage space, although would benefit from &quot;refreshing the decor&quot;. The hotels public areas seemed quite small but the service of the staff was excellent.Free internet service was good but valet parking $26.95 +tax and in-room water at $7 +tax were expensive. The hotel had a reasonably equipped gym, a hot tub and outside pool with sun loungers.",
8/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Lovely time at the Omni,"This review is a from a trip to Montreal my husband and I took in 2006, when we lived in Toronto (we now live in Montreal).We had found a great deal for Montreal's Omni Hotel on Expedia - under 100$ - and one of my biggest concern was getting a run down room or lesser service because of it, as is sometimes the case when booking online with these types of web sites. Not at all! Upon our arrival the valet was courteous and friendly, immediately assisting us with our luggage, and waited for us as we checked-in. The young lady who checked us in was nothing more than gracious, and she even commented with a smile that we were appointed a beautiful room, with a great view of the city. She was right! The valet chatted us to our room, asking us where we were from, and being very generous by telling us to not hesitate to call him if we ever needed anything. He actually wrote down his name and his extension on a piece of paper! The room was just perfect and exactly what we needed.We stayed for two nights, room was perfectly cleaned on the 2nd day when we came back, and our check out went smoothly, although the staff was not as nice or friendly as the young lady who had welcomed us. In fact, I found the young man who checked us out to be rather cold (the type who machinely asks &quot;so how was your stay&quot; while looking at this screen and who doesn't really listen to your answer) but the rest of our stay was so wonderful that we didn't pay attention to this detail. Parking is very pricey, but that is to be expected, however I will add that the parking service was efficient and fast.We loved our stay and will most certainly try the Omni again, in Montreal or elsewhere.",
8/21/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Wonderful hotel and decent rooms,My wife and I booked this hotel through priceline and were extremely happy with the rate we received. We were prepared for sub-par service as priceline customers but were met with incredible service over the phone and at check-in. As per some of the other reviews the rooms can use some updating but were still large and sufficient. With regards to Wifi as long as you sign up ahead of time as a Select Guest Member (you will start at Silver level) you can use your select guest member number to get on to the free wifi regardless of floor you are on. We were not charged for using wifi at the end of our stay. Overall the hotel and staff were excellent and we will definitely be recommending this hotel to our friends!,
8/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Great Service will truly be 4 star once the rooms are updated,"My daughter and I stayed at this property for 5 days. We got an amazing rate for the stay. I read the reviews in advance and expected the need for updates in the rooms. The service was fantastic. From the moment we arrived we were well taken care of. Bernard at the valet is simply adorable. A great asset! Our bags were removed from the car without asking and they just appeared next to us upon check in. We used the concierge several times and each time they were helpful. The location is fantastic. If you are into fitness they have great facilities with plenty of equipment and you can walk up the hill to Mount Royal and get a great workout on the stairs there! There is plenty of shopping near by. The Art Museum is right down the road (and free!). Easy metro to Old Montreal where we spent a great deal of time. Yes the rooms need to be updated. But it was not gross in any way ( and I have standards). The lobby and common space was great. I don't know if it was just a slow period, but it was also very quiet. Which was fantastic! If you are a spa regular, I don't recommend the Amerispa. I was disappointed with their facilities and the girl who gave me my facial had obviously just eaten onions (eww) She also was the same person to do my pedicure. Not a good sign. She was adorable. But not good at her job.Stay here while you can. Once they renovate the prices will go back up to 4 star rates.",
8/17/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hotel_omni_mont_royal,Brilliant Stay,"Stayed here as part of my 23 day tour of New England and Canada. Everything about this hotel, apart from the cost of a bottle of water, was brilliant!Super staff, breakfast and location. This was my first stay in an Omni hotel and i will certainly be using other hotels in this group.",
11/25/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,unexpected detour,"We had an unexpected detour. Montreal was not in our plans but it happens. The staff at the desk was awusume. Especially one, Ginette, she did far more that what any one expected. The hotel is on the metro and could not be better located. Thank you Ginette.",
11/21/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Deceptive,The remote battery was dead there was not sufficient wash cloths the bed wa squeekyThe service at the desk was rude and snoby The wireless is for a fee A good point were the employees at the garage friendly and helpfulI will not go back again it was very desapointing,
11/11/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Conveniently located in the heart of Montreal and great service.,The Hyatt Regency Montreal is located right in the centre of the city of Montreal. It is well connected to St. Catherine Street which is the main shopping street in Montreal which further connects one to 33 sq. kms of shopping area!The service is great and the room are spacious and comfortable.I highly recommend it to anybody visiting Montreal on business or for pleasure.,
11/10/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,A NICE PLACE,"We arrived a couple of hours earlier than check in and were told that we could not check in till 3pm, which was check in time. This was an inconvenience as we had to travel the streets for 2 hours while all we wanted to do was lay down and sleep for a few hours.",
11/6/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great hotel right downtown!,"Very nice hotel. A little confusing to find the lobby if you park in the Complexe Desjardins... but overall very nice room, great price and awesome view of &quot;Place des Arts&quot;.",
11/4/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great Location--average hotel,"Stayed 3 nights at the Grand Regency at the end of Oct/beginning of Nov. I was there for a conference, and this was the conference hotel. The adjoining conference center is quite nice, and the hotel location is quite convenient to Old Montreal, a metro stop, etc.The hotel is a bit disappointing. My wife and I arrived the first night to discover that they didn't have a king-size bed for us after all (the reservation had guaranteed it). Instead, we were given a single double bed for the first night. After a question about this, they gave us a coupon for the breakfast buffet, but we would have rather had the promised room. Fortunately, they switched it the next day, but it took all day to do so, and they didn't move our baggage as they said they would.The breakfast and hotel bar seem outrageously priced for what you get. Both are OK in quality, but not great.Location/cleanliness: very good to excellent.I think you could find much better hotels for the price, especially if you aren't going there for a conference at that center.",
10/29/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Not one of the better Hyatts but nice enough,"Location wise, the Hyatt is front and center to Place des Arts, which is usually ground zero for the Jazz and Franco Folies festivals, which can be a good thing. Otherwise, it's location is just OK, but it is right on the Metro line. Both times I stayed there, I booked through third party booking sites. Perhaps accordingly, I had odd rooms. The shower head and tap were in a weird spot and there was no minibar, which is always annoying (I'd like to at least have the option of using it if I want to).",
10/27/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Perfect place in Montreal,Great location near Old Montreal and other popular areas like St. Catherine and St. Laurent Streets. Comfy and clean and often available on Priceline for a great price.,
10/15/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Perfect Fall Getaway,"I have been a patron of the city of Montreal for many years and have stayed in lots of hotels. However, I must tell you this hotel was fantastic in location, service and amenities! The rooms were clean and comfortable. The service at the front desk, bellman, valet, conceirge, etc. were superb. The pool area is excellent with beautiful sliding doors, giving access to a pavillion with street views. The only complaint which is really not a biggie was there was no bar service until 5:00pm?! Just wanted to have a couple cocktails but ended up headed out on St. Catherine Street and hangin in the outdoor cafes. I highly recommend this safe(parking underneath the hotel), friendly and chic hotel to anyone familiar or unfamiliar with Montreal. Please feel free to email me if you have any other questions. :)",
10/9/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Good location good front desk staff,"Stayed there by myself for a marathon and got the executive package, which allowed me access to the concierge suite with free apps and private concierge. The private concierge wasn't great, as he wasn't around untill 1pm, but the free appetizers was nice Good location and friendly frontdesk. no official concierge, so if you have to ask for reccommendation you have to wait in front desk line which could be annoying if they were busy. Very close to good shopping, perfect location.",
9/21/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Decent,"Upon arriving at the Hyatt Regency we were quite impressed with the beautiful foyer and elegant decore. We'd seen on the website that they offered a romance package and figuring we might as well make bussiness trip double as a romantic weekend away. When we inquired about the 'romance package&quot; there was no such thing to our dismay.After checking in we realised that a long wait at the elevators was due to only two out of the four elevators were functioning it took over twenty minutes to get past the major line up.When getting to our room it was simple, an obviously dated hotel that had been given a few modern touches. Nothing spectacular. Spacious bathroom with a narrow bathtub, no options to upgrade to a jacuzzi. the room was adequate with a 21 inch tv, and king size bed that was quite firm. The room was clean upon arrival, we sayed for three and out of three days our room was only cleaned once, cleaning which didn't inclde restocking our minibed or changing the towels, as they are only changed every three days to save on cost. When we callled down for clean glasses and fresh towels, we were put on hold for 10 minutes after which we waited another thirty minutes, after calling down for a third time we finally had enough and went down to get our own glasses.There state of the art gym was lacking in the weight area, but is good for cardio. The pool was beautiful and kept at an amazing warm temperature. the lounging area for the pool is beautiful with a terrific sunroom. Right in the downtown area there is tons of shopping options and cabbing is easily done, fabulous location.All in all we paid a 125$ for a night for three nights stay, fabulous location. the hotel is absolute basic, no luxuries. My girlfriend stayed one night at 198$, for the same type of room on the same floor and would not do it again.",
9/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Mixed Emotions...,"Although well situated in the city, this hotel is by no means perfect. If you get a good deal, though, go for it!Most noteworthy...SET UP - As you've probably read in other reviews, it's a bit of a pain in the neck to navigate this hotel, as you first have to take an elevator several floors to the lobby before then doing the same to get to your room. Unfortunately, the elevators are a bit schizophrenic. LOCATION - Right in the mix of things - a short walk here and a short walk there. Also situated above a mall (with a full grocery store!).FITNESS / RELAXATION - As part of an apparent renovation, they clearly paid attention to the addition of a decent workout room with ample equipment. Also, the pool and deck area were very enjoyable. Be sure to enjoy the sauna and steam area, too.ROOM - This is where things start to get a bit sad. Although recently renovated, it looked somewhat worked over - not bad by any means but certainly not what you might expect given a recent makeover.SERVICE - A spotty area as well. Check in was a bit of a mess with a line of people and a desk staff that seemed off their game - unable to deal well with the volume of people and a variety of issues. One evening, the hotel hosted a wedding reception with music that kept hotel guests awake until 2:00 AM. Staff/management was ill-equipped to deal with this sort of frustration from guests.",
9/2/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,it will do,"location: it's a pretty far walk from old montreal, but it's walkable. with some connecting stops on the subway you can get to old montreal from the hotel to the champs-de-mars stop. the hotel is located about 2 blocks away from what i'd consider to be montreal's &quot;red light district.&quot; it is located on st. catherine street and if you walk a couple of blocks (5-6) towards dairy queen you start to hit some decent shopping.Eating: The diner, Eggspectations, is right down stairs, they make reallly good french toast! and the hotel is located right above the Complex des jardin's food court. the hotel has a restaurant, aswell, but it was under renovations while i was there.hotel: small rooms, dimly lit, basic amenities, small bathroom, not impressed. wouldn't stay again.",
8/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great hotel!,"We stayed here 2 nights and it was a lovely hotel. We were asked if we'd like 2 double beds or a king bed, so we took the latter. The room was spacious and comfortable, though my partner had a stiff/sore neck from the pillows but I guess he could have brought his own. The staff are very helpful and will tell you where to go if you don't quite know, or how to get to where you do want to go (Maria was helpful and saved us a long walk because my partner was under the impression that it wasn't so far away but it was, and Olga recommended which streets to wander for some nice restaurants). The gentlemen at the parking are great too - very nice, courteous and willing to help out in any way that they can (regular parking is $19, but each time you take your car out you will have to pay again, so we went with valet parking, which is $26 a day).We were able to get internet, 2 hours for $5 (and there are various other options for other prices), but once we also took advantage of the Starbucks across the street, bought some coffees and used their wifi.Only complaint - the washroom. Very small but still, it was clean and everything (although not so much the tub) was quite nice.",
8/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Great renovation of this nearly 35 year old hotel. . .,"This hotel started life as Le Meridien, and later had a Radisson flag on it, before the most recent renovation that sees the property managed by Hyatt. In the years since its opening just before the Olympics, its Complexe Desjardins location, across from Place des Arts, hasn't changed, but Montreal has gotten more interesting going eastward, so the hotel is more central than ever. . .Kudos to the owners and designers who carried out this renovation. Given the age of the hotel--a lot of Montreal was erected in the mid 60s to mid 70s, for the Expo 67 and 1976 Olympics, and not all has aged gracefully--the refurbishment was a near gut rehab. And a thorough one at that. . .new and fresh lobby, guest rooms, lounge areas, and fitness center.Rooms are not huge, but they are ample and airy. The original design of the building, sort of a checkerboard pattern, provides just half a window to the outside. Supposedly, the view I received, out over Place des Arts and a slice of Mount Royal, is a premium one with a surcharge--the front desk agent gave it to me as 1) I requested it, and 2) she was not sold out. Very nice of her, but the view would not be worth the $20 per night extra cost. Great Hyatt beds, in-room coffee, and brand new carpet are highlights. Odd that they did not install flat screen TVs given the newness of the reno effort. Bathrooms are well laidout, and more pleasant than their size would indicate. Great bumpy Portico soap and curved shower rods are nice touches, though the vanity has just one sink, and a small area at that.Interestingly, Priceline categorizes this hotel as a 3 1/2 star, while its freshness and amenities would be closer to 4 star in my book (especially given some of what Priceline does call 4 star). That rating accounts, in part, for the $63 US room rate bid that Priceline accepted--a steal for this hotel. It is to the hotel's credit that I was treated with VIP service, and upgraded even with this--some hotels treat you like the great unwashed if you are a Priceline purchaser.The hotel lobby is seven stories above the street, and the double elevator rides get a bit tedious--the trip to your room requires an elevator to the lobby, then a second set of elevators to get you through the guest room tower.The Complexe Desjardins/Place des Arts location puts guests within underground access to two Metro stations (with similar names, Place des Arts, and Place d'Armes), the Convention Center, and much of the rest of downtown Montreal's vast tunnel system. Complexe Desjardins, itself, is a large mall and office complex (the center court is one of the most voluminous retail spaces in the world. .) with a considerable food court at the lower level. Place des Arts, right across St. Catherine St. is Montreal's answer to Lincoln Center, with a number of performance spaces, and the hall for the Montreal Symphony. Chinatown is nearby, and the main downtown shopping stretch along St. Catherine is just a few blocks to the west of the hotel. St. Catherine going east, from about St. Urbain to St. Denis, is the closest thing downtown Montreal has to a red light district, and while it is not aggressively awful, it is not pretty, particularly at night. The gay Village starts just beyond St. Denis, about a 15 minute walk east. And north along St. Denis is the Quartier Latin, with countless cafes and restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk. Visitors who take the train into Central Station have about a six block walk.Overall the Hyatt can be a great choice, particularly when Priceline bids in the $60-70 range are accepted. Even at full price, the location and stylish renovation make this a strong hotel to consider for a Montreal visit.Good things:Complete renovation of a 34 year old hotel—stylish and comfortable update.Notably central location—within Complexe Desjardins for shopping and dining options, across from Place des Arts, and connected to underground city/convention center—covered access to two Metro stations.Brand new fitness facility and pool area, with sun deck, fitness center use freeGreat beds, new carpet, and numerous outlets—nice Portico bath products, and curved shower rods.Solid service—upgrade at front desk despite Priceline booking, waived two local calls’ charge, responsive housekeeping staff.Free in-cup coffee maker (though include paper cups—mugs only doesn’t cut it)Refrigerator, not mini bar, in room.Not good things:Not in the center of downtown—five blocks from core.Neighborhood just to east of the hotel along St. Laurent kind of sketchy.Double elevator—ground floor to lobby, then lobby to guest room tower—makes for longer time to room. As well, frequent elevator stops.Despite recent renovation, retained old style televisions.Charge for internet in rooms.",
8/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,WiFi not included,"I know its a minor thing, but the website suggested it was in the room. Like the towels and electricity we assumed it was included. It was not and forced us to use free services elsewhere. The TV was also an extra fee. The sink was plugged whenever we used it. And needless to say we spent as little time here as possible. Good points. The room was clean, the beds were made every morning and aside from listening to the FrancoFollies every night it was fairly peaceful on the 11th or so floor.",
8/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Clean comfortable good location... but not worth 4 stars,"I booked this hotel on Hotwire for about $96 USD/night. I wouldn't pay much more than that however.Good... clean, great downtown location, comfortable beds, friendly staff.Bad... it's not 4 star as advertised. 3.5 sure. The rooms and bathrooms need a little updating. Hotel movie had background &quot;static&quot;. Not great when you pay $12.99 for one.The real bad... the air conditioning. It was really warm in Montreal (above 30 degrees). The AC in the rooms couldn't keep up . While we had it on max, it was about 24 degrees in the room. They first came up... said it was broke... they'd send a repair person the next morning and if that didn't work, they'd change us to another two double room. And they sent a fan up. Next morning... nothing. We left for the day. Came back... called again... said they would call back in a few. No call. Third time he said he'd check into it. Nothing. Friendly but not very organized.Talking to other guests... we're thinking it wasn't broke and it just sucked to begin with.",
8/18/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Nice Stay Great Pool,"I stayed for 3 nights from August 8th to August 11th with my wife, 13 year old daughter and 8 year old daughter. The check-in was easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We found the Hyatt to be reasonably priced and and wonderfully situated. You can walk to all the downtown attractions and Old Montreal. The subway is directly under the hotel and can take you anywhere you want to go. There are many coffee shops with excellent muffins and pastries in the food court in the mall underneath the Hyatt which is only an elevator ride away and very convenient when you are traveling with children. The indoor pool was wonderful. When they opened all the glass doors around the pool we got a beautiful view of the city from the pool area. As one reviewer stated, there could have been more chairs around the pool but if that's going to ruin your vacation then stay home. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.",
8/15/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,definitly not a 4 star hotel,Not as good as the other Hyatts. Check in took forever. Valet parking was very slow. Rooms were clean but the bathroom had mold.,
8/15/2009,can_quebec_montreal_hyatt_regency_montreal,Worth it on sale.... otherwise?,"This hotel does not meet the Hyatt standards. While the staff is nice, and the location is great, the hotel is run down. The common spaces and rooms are nicely furnished, but for a hotel that is supposed to be four star, it's not. Rooms need money spent to update them (i.e. flat screen t.v.s) It's difficult to get into the hotel (one elevator to the lobby, and then one to the rooms), but it's location makes it worth $100 a night, not much more. Having stayed at another Hyatt property this week, I was disappointed with this one.",
11/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,We loved it!,"After reading the reviews, I had high expectations for the hotel and it lived up to them and more. My kids (4 and 7) upon arrival were immediately charmed by the bellhop guys who high-fived my youngest and talked hockey with my oldest. Really nice to take time like that for little guys. The room was huge and really comfy. A bit too much so, since my husband and I had a hard time getting them outside to see the city. They wanted to go swimming and watch the flat screen tv instead. The pool was really nice for them, and a great vista. However, it's much more of a lap pool. The parking was also convenient. There is a lot right next door and I think it is a bit cheaper. However, it's an outdoor lot and I'm fairly sure there rate of 10 CAD was not for 24 hours like the hotel. Overall, I thought the valet parking charge of 20 CAD was worth it. Overall, the only complaint I heard from our ranks was my husband who claimed the mattress was hard. I however, loved it since I like firmer mattresses. Also, map quest the hotel before you set out for it. The directions included on their website are really, really poor. Luckily we had our iphones and a basic understanding of the Montreal streets or we would have been horribly lost. Anyways, I highly recommend the hotel and can't wait to go back. Super friendly staff!",
11/2/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Lovely place great location helpful staff would stay here again,"Lovely place, great location. Can easily get to the ‘sights’. Old Town is within walking distance, as is Mount Royal (if you don’t mind walking up hill all the way). Metro station is about 2 minutes walk so can get to Olympic Park and Botanical Gardens very easily.Staff were very helpful. I don’t speak French but that wasn’t a problem as they were happy to converse in English.The Italian restaurant next door was really nice and very reasonable in price.If in Montreal again will definitely stay there again.If you are in Montreal go to the Old Town and get on the Jet Boat ride up the St Lawrence rapids, it is a real blast. You will get wet so if you do decide to do this (rather than a spur of the moment thing) then I would suggest you wear your speedos/costume and take underwear (and a towel) to change into after the trip. Woolly jumpers, over suits and lifejackets are provided, they are not designed to keep you dry.",
10/25/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Unique hotel with a great location,"My husband and I traveled here as the second part of our honeymoon trip in Canada. I had never been to Montreal before, so it was a bit hard for me to find (although that just might be my lack of city driving skills!)... However, once we found it, we were very pleased! This hotel is located right in the middle of the city, adjacent to Rue St. Catherine! The hotel does charge $20.00 a day for valet parking, but it's an amenity we didn't mind paying for. The concierge/valet service was extremely helpful and even offered to retrieve umbrellas from our car for us on a rainy day.The staff was extremely pleasant and courteous. Because we were on our honeymoon, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a larger room when we checked in. When we entered the room, we were totally blown away. This room was so huge, we didn't know what to do with ourselves!! The pictures online do it no justice, as our ceilings were easily 20 ft. tall, with a separate bedroom area, living area, and kitchen area. It was nicely neat and clean.We were located in the middle of downtown, where everything was just a walk away. Old Montreal was about a 20 minute walk, but this city is really pedestrian friendly. The concierge was really helpful with suggestions for dining out, and recommended some wonderful restaurants. There was complementary continental breakfast served each morning, and a small restaurant attached to the hotel. We didn't eat there, but we wish we had, as it looked good. The best part of the hotel is the roof deck with its amazing view of the city. There are lounge chairs and an indoor swimming pool on the roof. The scenery is incredible in that part of the hotel, and we were frequent visitors.In all, we had a very positive experience here. It was a very classic hotel with many strong points. We certainly recommend it to others!",
10/22/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,great location in addition to a charming little italian restaurant,"this really made our trip pleasurable and comfortable! the hotel's cleanliness and spacious rooms, in addition to the very professional staff, are only outshone by the good location in downtown Montreal as well as the lovely Italian restaurant where we took our lunch and cappucino. great value for money.",
10/20/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Best hotel of our entire trip,"We stayed in Montreal for 2 nights as part of a 5 week Canada and USA trip. This hotel was a highlight - well located within easy walking distance of the train station and the main shopping strip, yet in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. The room was huge, with a full kitchen/dishwasher and dining table, and the king sized bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel has a guest laundry and indoor pool on the top floor, and a no charge business centre for internet/computer access. Everything that a traveller needs. Reception staff were efficient and professional and there was no issue with us conversing in English. The only suggestion that I would make to the hotel is to improve the information contained within the guest services directory - there was no mention of the guest laundry, which we found quite by accident as we were exploring the pool area.",
10/9/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,We were very pleased!,"We spent 3 nights at Le Square Phillips and were very pleased with our choice. We booked a standard king suite through hotels.com for approximately $150/night. Given the location in a major metropolitan city, we felt we received an excellent value. As others have written, the rooms are huge. Spacious living area with very tall ceilings, a table with 4 chairs, a fully functional kitchen with full-size refrigerator and oven. The bathroom was adequate if on the older side. The bed was fine but firm, which we like but beware if firm mattresses don't agree with you. The bedding could have been of higher quality (you could nearly see through the sheets). Quiet stay and no issues with maid service.The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast which is on par with most complimentary hotel breakfasts. Plenty of cereal and pastry selections, fruit, yogurt, juice &amp; coffee.We loved the size of the room and the location in Montreal. We walked everywhere or took the Metro. Would definitely stay here again if we return.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Rare combo of chic and friendly,"We chose this hotel based on other tripadvisor reviews, and we're glad we did. It was a rare combo of chic and friendly. My husband and I loved the urban vibe, and the kids loved the room, the pool, and the breakfast. The hotel is well located, with friendly and helpful staff. A few caveats for families with young kids, though. The pool is 4m deep from end to end - too deep for kids to stand. Great looking flat screen tvs in rooms had limited kid-friendly channels, especially in English. Minor points, really, in an otherwise great stay.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Excellent Hotel!,"Le Square Phillips is an excellent hotel. The location is ideal; it is centrally located and near several Metro stops. Our room was great; the kitchen was well-equipped, the view was nice, and the unique architecture of building really stood out in the room design. I would recommend the hotel to families and couples alike. The free internet access on hotel computers and breakfast were added bonuses that a lot of up-scale hotels don't include in their offers.",
10/4/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great location,"Stayed for 5 nights in a double studio room. Hotel is just minutes from busy Rue Catherine but very quiet. Additionally, the hotel is also a short walk to Chinatown, Old Montreal and Metro lines. The room was just as the picture showed on their web page and had a spacious area where the dining table/kitchen was located. The bathroom was large and very clean.The continental breakfast options (included in the hotel rate) were okay but we chose to buy a selection of items at the markets (see my reviews of the Jean Talon and Atwater markets) on a couple of the days instead of the hotel provided breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.",
9/24/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Nice Hotel,"Located downtown, about a 20 minute walk to Old Town but close to many other attractions this is a smaller hotel with really big, comfortable rooms. Valet parking is $20 a day. Staff was cordial and helpful. Continental breakfast was included but that is my only minor complaint. Very basic, Motel 6-type spread.",
9/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,great deal on a conveniently located hotel friendly staff clean pack n play crib,"We stayed here on a 5-day vacation in August 2009. Had a nice problem-free stay in a large room (for no particular reason, we were upgraded to a larger suite than we booked). Fully equipped kitchen was nice- housekeeping did our dishes even though I think that was our responsibility. Room was nice and spacious but not fancy. Plenty of closet space. Clean Pack N Play crib was available for our one-year-old (although no one brought sheets). Hotel was quiet, staff were extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants, etc. Pizza place Il Focolaio a couple doors down was really good and had outdoor seating. French restaurant a block away Restaurant Julien was good but pricier. Rooftop pool and deck were small but nice to have. Valet parking was $20 per day. Free internet worked fine (have to ask for a password at the front desk). Free breakfast included the usual fare- sometimes we skipped it. Would stay here again.",

9/3/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,worst hotel experience in 10 years,"most overrated hotel. made a reservation based on trip advisor rating bnut TA way off on this one. arrogant check in staff, cold impersonal room, internet connection terrible, coffee and breakfast must be avoided. Room was large but so what. i had to empty the dishwasher when i checked in to get a cup for coffee. The gym is useless. Montreal is a great city. this hotel is like a plain vanilla hotel in any city. no feeling at all that one is in such a great city.I would never stay here again. do yourself a favor and find another hotel to stay in Montreal",
9/1/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Largest room ever,"Our Junior Suite 411 at the Square Phillips was the largest room I ever have experienced in my 25+ years of travelling around the globe. I took 19 large steps from the kitchen end to the window end and almost 6 steps the narrow side, This included bedroom, living room and kitchen. Partitions separated them somewhat. Additionally comes a long isle opening to a medium sized bathroom with missing decor and a walk in closet. Overall easily more than 100 square meters. Amazing! Obviously they had some space left when transforming the office building into a hotel. Location was good, though you needed ground transportation to go to the trendy latin quarter. Staff was helpful and friendly. The hotel was quiet though we had some loud neighbors baging doors Sunday early morning.Just one question: Who needs 2 oversized flat screen TVs in listening distance? WiFi worked fine.",
8/28/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Good Value,"Stayed here for two nights on a Friday and Saturday in late August as part of a trip to Montreal &amp; Quebec City. Great Value. Good location, easy-in easy out with Valet Parking. Its within walking distance of shopping old Montreal &amp; Chinatown (although a bit far for the later two).We had a large roon with a full kitchen complete with refrigerator, microwave, table plates and utensils. Breakfast was included but is limited but adequate(cereal, bagels, peanut butter, bread, muffins and fruit).Would certainly recommned for families and for longer satys.",
8/27/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Ideal location but not perfect,"The location in downtown Montreal cannot be beaten - ideal for shopping, cultural activities, visits to museums and old Montreal. The rooms are certainly large with confortable beds, although the decor and bathrooms appear somewhat dated. Free internet access if provided to those with their own computer - otherwise at the business centre on the first floor. Breakfast is served until 0930 and the breakfast room gets overcrowded with families vying for tables and squeezing past each other to get to the food - which is basic fare. Check in staff were OK but did not bother to explain the hotel's facilities. The biggest pain was the housekeeping staff - they will even enter the room while you are at breakfast and before you are even ready for the day ahead, or they will call you on the phone to ask when you are leaving. However, their activities did not seem to stretch to changing the bed linen - during a week long stay, this did not happen once.",
8/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Wonderful location and lots nearby,"I stayed for three nights and it was wonderful! Check in was quick and the staff friendly. Concierge answered my questions and mapped out where/how to get to places. Valet parking was easy. Location is great. You are 1 1/2 blocks from Ste Catherine's Street which is very active with lots of restaurants, shops, and people. I felt fine to walk around alone. You are also within blocks of many churches and museums. Leave your car with the valet and use subway and buses. The system was easy to get around. Breakfast at the hotel was fine...mostly breads, fruit, cereal and juice...enough for me. My room was quite large and when I asked apparently I had a smaller room. It had 2 beds, a full kitchen and a large bathroom. Very clean. I would definitely plan to stay there again.",
8/24/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great for teens,Great location. Big rooms which our two teenagers liked. Excellent service and very secure. Two Internet terminals in business centre at lobby level. Breakfast could be better if there were more choices. Small gym and beautiful swimming pool on top level. Also a nice deck on roof. Central to downtown Montreal. Beds are very firm but we were ok with them. Would definitely go back.,
8/24/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Great set up all-around,We spent four nights in a two bedroom suite - incredibly spacious. The hotel is very centrally located so you can walk in many different directions. The included breakfast is very simple but it is quick and easy and filling. It is very nice not to have to look for another restaurant for a meal.The pool is small but very nice with a nice roof-top deck.The hotel is very quiet. I was always surprised at how many people were in the breakfast room given that we didn't hear or see them at any other time of day.We will definitely go back to this hotel,
8/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_le_square_phillips_hotel_suites,Lovely---Perfect for our little family.,"Most have already covered what we would say. It would be nice to see a bit more variety in the breakfast, but that is our only small quibble. It is so comfortable, and the service was fabulous--they were lovely and classy, and not at all pretentious. The pizza place a few doors down had good thin-crust pizza--you can take it back to your room or eat on the patio area there, so it's really convenient. The hotel downstairs was nice, but a bit pricier/nicer than necessary for a family with an impatient small child. They were very accommodating, but it was kinda wasted on her 4-year-old sensibilities.",
11/25/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great hotel and location!,"As a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold Member, no upgrade was available at check-in. However, I was provided with complimentary access to the Club Lounge. Upon entering the lounge, when I gave my hotel room number, the attendant called the front desk and was advised I was not eligible. This was rather embarrassing!",
11/23/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great location - sloppy maintenance ,"This hotel is in a great location, very central to everything. My room had an amazing view of the mountain, and the bed was very comfortable. However, the room, despite apparently being recently updated, looked tired. Weird decor &amp; color combinations, and the carpet felt nasty (rough) underfoot, as well as being ugly. If this is a renovation, they should get their money back. No mini-fridge in the room. Housekeeping was sloppy and erratic - one day, wet towels were left on the side of the tub. Another day, a towel and a dust rag were left in the room. My ice bucket (full of melted ice in the morning) was not emptied out on two days. Sometimes I got new tea bags, other days I didn't get new tea bags. Someone else's room service cart with leftover food was left sitting outside my room for most of a day. The pop machine on my floor was out of order the day I arrived, and it had not been fixed when I left, 7 days later..... The front desk folks were very helpful and friendly, but I was not impressed with the overall maintenance and housekeeping. Food at this hotel was generally good, but one day they served Montreal bagels for our conference - they were yesterday's bagels and they were stale/hard. The local Montreal folks were mortified. Considering how much everything cost at this hotel, you would think they could get fresh bagels that morning. The meeting rooms were nice - it was a good hotel for this conference, but I would not likely stay here if it wasn't the conference hotel.",
11/20/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Decent weekend at the Sheraton,"My husband and I stayed here with our 9 month old for a weekend. We used Starwood points for our stay and booked a room on the club floor. A few days before our stay, we got an email offering an upgrade to a suite for just $20.00/night, so of course we took advantage of this. When traveling with a baby, the more space the better. We got a really nice suite on the club floor. It was basically 2 rooms with an open door between them. One of the rooms was set up as a bedroom and the other was a living room. The club lounge had amazing views of the city and was a nice place to start off the day for breakfast or unwind for a drink and some snacks after a long day of sightseeing. The breakfast was fine - the typical things you'd find in a continental breakfast buffet. At night, though, it was not the best selection of food - mozzarella sticks that had stayed out too long, or were stale, and some other odd choices. But it was free, so who can complain?! The alcoholic drinks, however, were not free, and you can expect to pay typical hotel prices for these. The location was good, right in the middle of everything in the Downtown area. We ordered room service, and it was exactly what you'd expect from room service, but was not disappointing.All in all, it was a good stay with no complaints, and we would definitely stay here again.",
11/10/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,great renovations,"Living just south of the Canadian border in Upstate New York, my wife and I from time to time go to Montreal for a nice getaway. Years ago, when the Expos were there, I started staying at the Sheraton because all the visiting baseball teams stayed there. As the years passed, it just so happend that I stayed at other hotels, sometimes because they were the sites of conferences I was attending. I kind of forgot about the Sheraton. I had noticed in driving by the hotel that the lobby had been redone but had not gone inside to take a look. Last week, we went to dinner in Montreal and stayed the night. We decided to stay at the Sheraton and we were very glad we did. They have done a wonderful job on renovating the hotel, particularly the lobby. The front of the hotel on Rue Rene Levesque is glass sided for the first two stories. Under the previous arrangement, guests did not get to experience how spectacular this could be. The bar was tucked off on the side in a windowless area. It has now been moved to the front of the lobby. Anyone sitting at the bar or at tables or sofas throughout this area is in for a treat. My wife and I had a drink and finger foods while sitting on a sofa and just people watched pedestrians going by. The tables have wing-backed chairs and are also very pleasant (We had a nightcap there after dinner.) Lest I concentrate too much on the lobby bar, the entire hotel has been spiffed up. Our room was a good size and since we are members of the Starwood Preferre Guest program, we were placed on a separate floor. I don't precisely how this affected our room amenities, but the room was nice. The Sheraton has always had a great location, close by everything downtown yet just out of the way of the hub bub of St. Catherine Street. The Bonaventure (Hilton) and Chateau Champlain (Marriott) are lovely hotels but they are just slightly out of the way and down a short incline from most of downtown. If you have not been to the Sheraton in a while, I think it would be worth it to check out the changes, particularly if you can get a good rate.",
11/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Excellent weekend getaway,"Over Thanksgiving weekend, I decided last minute to head to Montreal, and thought I'd try out the Centre Sheraton. Now I've been in it before, though I had heard that the whole hotel had been recently renovated and so I looked forward to seeing what it had to (newly) offer. Not only was I surprised, but my expectations were surpassed. Here's a breakdown of the stay:Parking and Check in: Check in was quick, efficient, and the front desk worker was very efficient and friendly. I've stayed at many hotels in Montreal, and I can say that this one had the best value (under 20$) for parking costs, and with it being at a central location, I was impressed. The room:I had booked a Deluxe room and was put on one of the top SPG floors. The Deluxe room was probably about 10$ more than the standard room, but had a full sized couch (also a pull-out) so I thought it was worth it. The website still has some pictures from before the entire hotel being renovated, but the room was larger than most, comfortable bed, LCD television, and what was interesting was that it was wired and set up that you could connect media from your laptop directly to the TV, as well as a USB connector (I was able to charge my iPod with its cord without needing an adapter to plug it into the wall)I was pretty sure that each room would come with an MP3 dock, but apparently that's only on the Club rooms (for now). The bathroom was also nicely updated!I saw the pool and gym briefly, though didn't use them. They looked decent, though. I definitely would recommend staying at the Centre Sheraton for a GREAT value, it's RIGHT NEXT to the Bell Centre if there's a game or concert you want to check out. You'll be glad you did!",
11/7/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great location service and value,"As someone who spent five years living in Montreal, I knew what I needed for this trip. Looked online and found this hotel for a great deal! $120 CAD a night, including all taxes. Can't go wrong. The hotel is centrally located, an easy walk from the train station. We were heading to the hockey game, and this hotel is ACROSS THE STREET. Great hotel, really really quiet. Can't say that we used any of the amenities of the hotel, or even the service per se, but it was a great stay all around. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
11/7/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Perfect place for a nice weekend in town,"Very nice staff, they where very helpfull in planing our weekend ( museum and activity for the little one). Food a bit pricy but so many good restaurant around. The room was perfect. And the pool-sauna area is really nice and quiet.",
10/30/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Amazing hotel with amazing customer service...,"Arrived in the morning and was able to check in without any trouble. Excellent customer service as I was attended to almost instantly after walking through the turn-about entrance.We received a corner room with facing west, with views of Mont-Royal. The room was clean and comfortable with a large LCD TV. This hotel is within walking distance to the metro station and within walking distance to great nightlife and shopping.",
10/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great Stay But....,"Good location, good staff, nice room but no restaurant in the hotel for evening meals if you have children. If you have children you are directed to the &quot;family&quot; area which is three small tables, basically in the lobby. I would not have stayed there if I had known this. Of course, room service was available.",
10/26/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great hotel great location.,"Very nice hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal. I've stayed at pretty much all the four star properties in the downtown area (Fairmont, Marriott Chateau Champlain, etc) and I think this one is the nicest. While it's not connected directly to the metro like the Fairmont, Hilton and Marriott it does have a great location convenient to nightlife, restaurants, St. Catherine's, etc. The rooms though can't be beat. They've been very recently updated, great furnishings, huge LCD TV, giant granite and slate bathroom and some of the most comfortable bedding you'll sleep on in a hotel. Rooms are very clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was conveniently in the hotel and was average price ($20 CAD). Didn't try the restaurant but the bar did look VERY nice. I think this may be my new go-to place in Montreal.",
10/16/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,How wonderful the hotel and its staff!!!,"Hi, My name is Tsering and I would like to share this wonderful experience of me and my siblings who stayed at your hotel for three nights.When we first arrived the gentlemen at the front desk took great care of us and we had no problems checking in.The check-in was fast and professional.The moment we enter our room it gives us feel at home, we requested for a fridge prior to our arrival and it was there. The room was spotlessly clean and smells fresh.What we like the most is the swimming pool which is so well maintained and also the design and deepness of the pool is perfect for all guest, no matter it is for kid as the level of deepness is not that deep so we really enjoyed swimming in your pool.The location was the prime reason we choose your hotel because we came to attend His Holiness The Dalai Lama's public talk which held at the Bell Centre and it was just a walking distance. Overall our experiences in your hotel is so memorable and whenever we drop in Montreal in near future we will definitely stay at your hotel.",
10/14/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Perfect stay!,"This hotel was in the perfect spot, handy to everything we wanted to see. It was very clean and the staff was always cleaning something-the hallways or rooms. The rooms were very quiet and relaxing along with really comfy beds! The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. We would definately stay here again!",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Wonderful Find at a Very Terrific Price,"I booked the Sheraton Le Centre Montreal Hotel with minimal expectations, primarily due to paying less than $100 for the 1 night room on Hotwire. However, my girlfriend and I exceedingly impressed with the property due to many factors, including its terrific located (central to both Old Montreal and Mont Royal), modernly designed guest rooms, FREE wi-fi for your laptop, reasonably priced parking ($20 CAD/night) a nice pool and exercise facility, and overall staff curteousness. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat and was very pleased with our stay.",
10/8/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Stay for the beds!,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was recently renovated and comfortable. The bed was the best! Hotel is located downtown near shopping, but it's easy to get around using the metro or the BIXI bike share.",
9/28/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Great stay,Very nice stay at the Sheraton in downtown Montreal. Got a room on the 9th floor. A little smaller than what I'm used to but very comfortable. Love those pillows !!Putting the ice machines next to the service elevator is weird. It's not a part of the hotel that guests should have to see.Nice pool and hot tub.This is a great downtown location. Can't miss.,
9/27/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,A nice romantic getaway,"We decided to enjoy a &quot;staycation&quot; of sorts by travelling from Ottawa to Montreal instead of heading down south to an all -inclusive for our second wedding anniversary. We decided to try the Sheraton downtown Montreal as we have stayed at the Sheraton in other cities and enjoyed our stay. Upon arrival I mentioned that I was a Gold Member and received a complimentary upgrade to the 30th floor, a King room, with a gorgeous view of Montreal and Mont-Royal - perfect for watching the sunset. The room was recently renovated, luxurious bedding, very clean and modern decor. The room was quiet, we managed to sleep in until at least 9am every day, no late night or early morning interruptions. My only complaint would be the lack of a mini-fridge in the room. As we were staying multiple nights it would have been nice to be able to stock some cold beverages &amp; snacks. The hotel was walking distance to Old Montreal, Mont-Royal &amp; St-Catharines street.",
9/15/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Luxury at The Sheraton,"We took a short break (Monday to Friday) whilst visiting family in Toronto. We arrived at the hotel on foot from the VIA rail station which is just a short (4-5 minute) walk away and walked up to reception, handed them my email booking and they handed me my room key after recording the details of the credit card. Took all of 3 minutes and we were on our way up to 34th floor in a high speed lift. Amazingly quick check in and despatch to our room. We were in room 3421 and it was a corner Club room. We opened the door and gasped with pleasure. The room was beautiful, modern and spacious. The wardrobe was plenty big enough and the marble bathroom was large as well. The shower was very good and the toiletries provided were first class and replenished daily. Plenty of towels as well including face cloths. There was a hair dryer and a safe in the wardrobe. There was an easy chair, a desk, internet access and this huge TV. The decoration of the room was great and very comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable and adorned with 4 huge soft pillows. The room was cleaned expertly daily and the staff very courteous and smiled a lot. The Club Room on 37th Floor was fabulous as well and the staff there again were smiling and helpful. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and replenished continuously. Fresh coffee ground coffee as well. The hors d'oeurves from 5 pm were a bonus too if you didn't want to eat until late as well and quite a variety as well. The bar on the ground floor was lively as this was also a conference hotel but that did not interfere with us in any way at all, I was worried that the club room might get too busy for us to find a seat, but that was never the case. There was a nice pool, whirlpool, sauna and outside sun area on 6th floor which was never crowded and always clean. The only fault that I could find with this hotel, and I am digging deep here, was that there was no mirror over the desk so drying my hair in comfort was a little awkward and I would have liked a flatter pillow as I have neck problems (told you I was digging deep). Checkout was just as simple as check in and no queues. The concierge was fine as well, but we only used her once and she came up with what we asked for. We were a 30 minute walk from Old Montreal and St Catherine Street with all the shopping was just behind the hotel. Metro and VIA rails station all close by. All in all, I highly recommend ia stay at this hotel if you like polite, discrete, friendly professional staff and a great room with a great view and Club facilities. Worth every penny! Oh, another unexpected bonus, we caught the end of the film festival and were treated to an expert outdoor display of acrobatics, music and other activities absolutely free!",
9/13/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Beautiful rooms terrible service,"My spouse and I stayed at this property for two nights for a little getaway. We had booked this room as a reward stay for one night and a regular rate for the following night. Even before we arrived there were problems with our reservation. The information on the reservations was incorrect and they had us booked in two rooms for one night. It was a good thing I called to ensure that everything was correct before we arrived. That was strike one.When you arrive at this property it looks like any other nicely maintained large scale hotel; large lobby, large lounge and restaurant area, connections to shopping areas etc. The check in process was fine but I felt that the staff were not very polite. There were two conventions in the hotel while we were there so I can understand that the staff may have been rushed/tired etc., but first impressions and customer service count for a great deal, so suck it up.Since I'm an SPG member I was upgraded to the SPG (31st) floor of the hotel. The room was spacious with beautiful linens and a lovely view of downtown Montreal and Mount Royal. The money that the Sheraton chain spent on their worldwide reservations has been a good investment as the room are really quite nice.My issue with our stay was the service we received. As part of the renovations each room in the hotel now has a nice flat screen television with an area that allow HDMI and VGA hookups from your laptop to the television. Since we prefer the Starwood group of hotels we were aware that most properties have this feature and brought proper cables along to watch movies from our laptop on the television. We had problems getting the audio function of this interface to work and called to front desk for some help. After about 20 minutes a general maintenance worker came to our room and tried to 'fix' the problem. I get that not everyone knows how this type of interface works but do not send someone without the proper expertise to fix the issue! We never did get that problem resolved. It's also probably good for me to point out that the tv, while capable of producing a high definition picture, is not connected to any high definition channels.My second issue was the extremely early knock on the door that I got for the delivery of our hotel bills and the lack of coordination with our hotel reservations. Since one night was a reward stay and the other was a regular rate stay the hotel kept these as separate folios, so I got separate invoices, even though I expressly asked for them to be combined both when calling in advance of our arrival and upon arrival. Now in most hotels that we have visited, and we have stayed in many worldwide, your invoice arrives in the middle of the night, typically slid under the door. At this property, however, the staff felt it necessary to knock on our door and wake us for the delivery of this invoice at 7:50 am on a Saturday. Now I know that for the early riser this may not be that great of an inconvenience, but this was supposed to be a romantic getaway where we could sleep late and do things at our own pace. In addition to this inconvenience, we were awoken again an hour later by housekeeping and were harassed an additional time in the morning by housekeeping again even though we had a 'do not disturb' sign on our door. I would like to note that this same early morning knock on the door with the bill and the early housekeeping arrival happened again on the second morning.As part of our getaway we wanted to take in some of the sights and attractions that Montreal has to offer. We called the concierge and learned that the hotel carried discount tickets to the Biodome. We indicated that we were going to pick up some tickets and that we were coming right down. When we arrived at the concierge's desk, no one was there and we encountered the third issue with this stay. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up and help us. We spoke to the bell captain and another lady who both said that there was nothing that they could do to assist and that we would have to wait. I understand that staff are entitled to breaks and such, but if you know you are going to be away for more than a few minutes, leave a sign or some indication of when you will return. When the concierge returned we told him that we were waiting for a while and he brushed us off stating that he had 'other stuff to do' and that's why he wasn't available. Not a good excuse when your sole function is to provide guests with a service.Our fourth problem with this stay reared its head when we arrived back at the hotel that afternoon. Our keys did not work on our room door any longer. Since our reservations were not amalgamated, like I requested twice before, our keys' functionality expired and we had to get them re-magnetized. On its own, this would have been a mild hindrance, but it was just adding to the other annoyances we had already experienced.Our fifth problem was our final bill. Since the reservations were not amalgamated we were charged incorrectly for certain items, namely internet and parking. We were charged double for the internet and charged for valet parking, even though we used the self park option. I had to call the hotel after we left to confirm that the extra charges were removed. (An aside on self parking vs valet: use the self park and save a few bucks as the valet and self park are all housed in the same parking structure that is part of the hotel.)Needless to say, our experience was really soured by this lack of good service. This hotel really ends up giving the Starwood chain a bad name in Montreal. We will not be staying here again. If you are looking for a beautiful room with bad service, this is the hotel for you.",
9/12/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Couldn't ask for a nicer hotel!,"My husband, myself and another couple just returned from a three night stay at the Le Centre. Our room was immaculate, very comfortable and had a beautiful view of the city from the 28th floor. The room had plenty of space to put away a lot of clothes ( I don't travel light). Although there was a charge for internet in the room we had no trouble connecting in the public spaces. Breakfast in the restaurant was served promptly, we never had to wait for a table, and offered an extensive menu with lots of healthy choices.The concierge was very helpful and suggested a lovely bistro (Laloux).The day after we checked out we discovered we had left an expensive new purchase in the room. To our amazement the housekeeping staff had promptly turned it in and the hotel Federal Expressed it to us within a day of arriving home.",
9/10/2009,can_quebec_montreal_sheraton_le_centre_montreal_hotel,Terrible Experience,"We were given room 3621, a room on the last Club Room VIP floor, and the room was so noisy we woke up at 2:00 am and called to get the room changed to another one on the 35TH floor which had less noise. Anyway they told us that the mechanical room was righ on top. MY question is: Why don't they fix it?",

# Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis

### Objective:
This project was conducted to address the challenges posed by the rapid increase in textual information from sources such as social media, consumer reviews, and feedback within today's data-driven businesses. These challenges include the need for data-driven decisions to remain competitive and flexible in the market. However, traditional on-premises systems struggle to effectively harness and utilize this data.

In response to these challenges, this project aims to assist hotels in Montreal by developing a text-mining strategy. This strategy involves consolidating customer feedback from various online platforms, including booking websites, social media, and specialized review sites, into a non-structural database (No-SQL). Subsequently, the project involves data cleaning and text preprocessing to ensure data quality.

The primary focus of this project is to conduct three sentiment analysis models to evaluate customer experiences when visiting Montreal. The sentiment analysis helps categorize customer feedback as positive or negative, providing valuable insights to hotel businesses. Specifically, the project works with data from 10 hotels in Montreal, each with 20 reviews, to enable businesses to identify areas for improvement based on customer feedback.

In summary, the project's overarching goal is to leverage text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to assist hotels in Montreal in making data-driven decisions, improving customer experiences, and staying competitive in the market.
